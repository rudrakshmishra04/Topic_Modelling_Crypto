Please try posting again with the direct link to the article (You shouldn't see ""amp"" anywhere in the URL) or contact the moderators if you need help.

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

Central banks are not about to upend the apple cart and jeopardize $1.5T of **any** market class by trying to regulate it out of existence. That's too much distributed wealth to try to just wish away.

The problem that the Central Banks have now is that those institutions have enough wealth and political clout to change laws surrounding cryptocurrencies. As long as it was just retail investors, regulation remained a major potential risk. But once the big financial institutions and corporations started buying it, the Central Bank's hands were effectively tied and the politicians these companies have bought and paid for aren't about to let any significant laws be passed against it."

I think the main concern for governments now is how to efficiently tax gains. Looking at the UK’s HMRC page on crypto, they’re pretty much on top of it. 

The most invasive step would be to force declaration of crypto assets. As there is no bank or institution that they can gain access to with a court order, I imagine this concern will be at the forefront."

Do yourself a solid and read up on candle patterns. What I see on the first image with the happy dude is a mix of what is named a ""Bearish kicker"" and a ""bearish harami"" if my memory serves me well.

Of course one cannot predict candles down to tee. However, understanding candle patterns can long term really help you get in, or stay away from a trade. Especially when you read the 1 day or 1 week candle charts to get a larger perspective.

And don't worry. It will bounce back ;)

&#x200B;

Edit: On the second image I also see what is called ""3 black crows"" (the 3 red sticks before the green one) followed by a ""hanging man"" green stick.

I'm not even making these fucking names up lol

Afterthought: Another great reason to understand candlestick patterns is, that it gives you more confidence in the long term, which will help you avoid panic selling/buying."

gp5m0a1,,Comment,3,0,2021-02-28 04:57:14,"Long explanation here: https://senatusspqr.medium.com/how-nanos-lack-of-fees-provides-all-the-right-incentives-ee7be4d2b5e8

Short version:

When you run a Nano node, there are no *direct* monetary incentives. No fees, no inflation. The reason for this choice is that without direct fees paid, there is no [emergent centralization](https://medium.com/@clemahieu/emergent-centralization-due-to-economies-of-scale-83cc85a7cbef). In cryptocurrencies where fees are paid either for mining or for staking, there are economies of scale at work. In mining I think these economies of scale are very clear, but the same is the case in staking networks where the big get bigger because they receive the most in transaction fees.

Nano chooses to not do this. That being said, there are indirect monetary incentives. Parties run a Nano node - not out of altruism, but as a smart business decision. Primarily this happens for two reasons:

1. If you are a business that profits from the Nano network being up, you want the network to stay up. On [Nanocharts](https://nanocharts.info/) you can see the largest representatives - the top 4 being Nendly (a forum that uses Nano), Kappture (a point of sale processor that implemented Nano), Nanovault (a Nano wallet) and Kraken (an exchange that trades Nano). These parties have a vested interest in the Nano network being online, hence they run a node. The same holds true for many other exchanges (Huobi, Kucoin, Wirex) and wallets (Natrium, Nanowallet, Atomic Wallet).
2. If you are a business using Nano, you want to be able to use the network trustlessly. If you are, for example, Binance, you do not want to rely on an outside party to tell you whether the $10 million Nano deposit was actually deposited. So what you do is you run your own node, so that you can check for yourself whether the transaction has been confirmed.

Aside from the theoretical exercise that I'm describing here, the facts also speak in Nano's favor. If you check the [vote weight distribution](https://nanocharts.info/p/01/vote-weight-distribution) you can literally *see* Nano getting more decentralised over time. You can also see that there are many nodes, so the incentive structure seems to be working."
gp4qbfp,,Comment,3,0,2021-02-28 00:54:16,"The short answer is there is no direct incentive to run a node on NANO.

[This was posted last month by a hobbiest and will likely become a much more common problem as transaction levels rise:](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/l9ybip/the_but_of_nano_has_no_fees_closing_node_074/)

At least in Bitcoin and LTC, mining nodes are directly incentivised to have a copy of the blockchain. That fallback just isn't there in NANO.

I think Nano has some room to grow before it really starts to thin out nodes, but if running a node doesn't gain a direct incentive, it's probably going to run into problems."

Short version:

When you run a Nano node, there are no *direct* monetary incentives. No fees, no inflation. The reason for this choice is that without direct fees paid, there is no [emergent centralization](https://medium.com/@clemahieu/emergent-centralization-due-to-economies-of-scale-83cc85a7cbef). In cryptocurrencies where fees are paid either for mining or for staking, there are economies of scale at work. In mining I think these economies of scale are very clear, but the same is the case in staking networks where the big get bigger because they receive the most in transaction fees.

Nano chooses to not do this. That being said, there are indirect monetary incentives. Parties run a Nano node - not out of altruism, but as a smart business decision. Primarily this happens for two reasons:

1. If you are a business that profits from the Nano network being up, you want the network to stay up. On [Nanocharts](https://nanocharts.info/) you can see the largest representatives - the top 4 being Nendly (a forum that uses Nano), Kappture (a point of sale processor that implemented Nano), Nanovault (a Nano wallet) and Kraken (an exchange that trades Nano). These parties have a vested interest in the Nano network being online, hence they run a node. The same holds true for many other exchanges (Huobi, Kucoin, Wirex) and wallets (Natrium, Nanowallet, Atomic Wallet).

gp6bps9,,Comment,2,0,2021-02-28 09:47:54,"That article basically points out mining as a potential bottleneck with blockchain-based technologies...

It then goes on to dismiss all of blockchain based on things that may happen in the *future.*

It then discusses Nano *without any respect* to the growing pains it is going to face in the future.

For example:

>If you are a business that profits from the Nano network being up, you want the network to stay up. Nanocharts shows the largest representatives - the top 4 consisting of Nendly (a forum that uses Nano), Kappture (a point of sale processor that implemented Nano), Nanovault (a Nano wallet) and Kraken (an exchange that trades Nano). These parties have a vested interest in the Nano network being online, hence they run a node. The same holds true for many other exchanges (Huobi, Kucoin, Wirex) and wallets (Natrium, Nanowallet, Atomic Wallet), who all run nodes.

It's correct that there are plenty of NANO nodes currently up... Because it *currently* requires about 40GB of database space, 8GB or ram, and a consumer level internet connection... under normal circumstances.

Because bloat and spam attacks aren't completely disincentivised, you *also* need to overbuild node rigs to a large degree even today.

Nowhere have I seen it addressed how the NANO network is going to change and adapt based on an increasing number of users.

Because with each new transaction comes a bit more cost for the node operator.

And if you double the number of transactions, you double the required hard drive space.

And if you double the number of TPS, you double memory and network requirements.

So you're correct that *right now* of course things look decentralized in NANO.

But as transaction levels rise, so do node costs. And eventually we get to the point where businesses start saying ""Do I shell out to improve hardware again, or do I use the same network for free and not pay to run a node?

[And therein lies the biggest problem.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem)

Everyone is pumped to use this network completely for free, but nobody is really incentivised to run it... Especially at enterprise-server-levels, which is where it's headed.

And sure, businesses may want to keep the network running because they save some money, but everyone compares their savings to Visa and Master Card... But that's not all we have anymore.

You also have fractional cent options like BCH and if you're worried about ASIC mining, XMR.

Further you have 0-cent options like XLM (which has a couple of different trade-offs, but will still be in the wheelhouse of what NANO will be competing with.)

Suddenly, the business has the choice of ""Do I spend thousands on a NANO node for a savings of almost nothing or literally nothing over other competing cryptos, or do I just suck up a fractional-cent cost for each transaction?""

Meanwhile, while it's still running, they can ride on NANO for free.

Down the line and if it keeps growing, we're almost guaranteed to see more NANO nodes drop. Centralization will become an issue when that node count gets low."

-and-

2) It still has a lot of room to grow before it *really* starts to run into (centralization/node cost) walls.

It certainly has a chance to become something amazing but it certainly doesn't solve all problems of crypto as some redditors seem to think.

Feeling like participating in a Chinese Communist Party roleplay? Feeling like mauling some pro democracy protestors and innocent bystanders 
under TANKs like what happened at Tienanmen Square in 1989. Then welcome! This game is for you!

You can mint fresh new TANKs starting at 1000 TANKs, going down linearly at every mint to a cap of 1 million TANKs.
Minting TANKs are free. Just use the mint function and voila! 
However you cannot mint TANKs to an account if it already has TANKs. First use them to Tienanmen style genocide!

How to use TANKs? If you are a special kind of oppressor then you will send TANKs to the Tiennanmen Square
(by sending TANKs to any other account). There is a 50:50 chance that
1.	your send will be successful 
OR
2.	you will lose half of your TANKs to the pro democracy movement lead by the great CZ

These lost TANKS accumulate under CZ’s leadership and once in every 20 transfers, CZ randomly sends his TANKs to one sender
assuming the sender will support the pro democracy movement. So with every send you are playing a 1/20 dice to get a TANK load of TANKs.

Little does CZ know that all of you are puppets and are going to use those TANKs to inflict more pain!

There’s no interface or website, no airdrops. Mint for free from the contract and then just SEND IT!!

1989 Tiananmen Square protests

... At about 1:30 am, the vanguard of the 38th Army, from the XV Airborne Corps, arrived at the north and south ends of the Square, respectively.
They began to seal off the Square from reinforcements of students and residents, killing more demonstrators who were trying to enter the Square.
Meanwhile, soldiers of the 27th and 65th armies poured out of the Great Hall of the People to the west, and those of the 24th Army emerged from 
behind the History Museum to the east. The remaining students, numbering several thousand, were completely surrounded at the Monument of the 
People’s Heroes in the center of the Square. At 2 am, the troops fired shots over the students’ heads at the Monument. 
The students broadcast pleadings toward the troops: “We entreat you in peace, for democracy and freedom of the motherland, 
for strength and prosperity of the Chinese nation, please comply with the will of the people and refrain from using force against peaceful student demonstrators.”
On the morning of June 4, many estimates of deaths were reported, including from CCP-affiliated sources. 
Peking University leaflets circulated on campus suggested a death toll of between two and three thousand ...

Honestly, though, shady marketing tactics aside it kind of makes sense to rely on a centralised blockchain if the intention is to use something temporarily until Eth 2.0, L2s, or other smart contract platforms can demonstrate usability and security. The centralised nature of BSC actually helps allay fears of major security flaws or vulnerabilities.

No doubt Binance will continue pushing BSC even when better, trustless alternatives exist, but hopefully acts like the one covered in the article, and common sense will prevail to prevent that happening.

Will be interesting to see if Binance will bid to become a Dot parachain."

gp4xait,,Comment,19,0,2021-02-28 01:43:03,"I'm not sure which entities have ownership stakes in Binance, but I don't think that China could really *force* Binance to take it down, since it's currently headquarted in ~~crypto-friendly Malta~~ [the crypto-friendly Cayman Islands](https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2020/11/Binance_Complaint.pdf). It only existed in China for less than a year after being founded because of how soon after they started cracking down on the technology.

It would seem weird for me for China to have any serious ownership stake given how they've treated crypto in general, although maybe they're fine with it as long as their citizens don't have access to it... but then again, the bigger crypto becomes, the more of a threat it poses to China, so maybe they wouldn't be okay with encouraging its growth, even if only internationally."

gp600f6,,Comment,6,0,2021-02-28 07:34:38,"I imagine it was done in this case because it hits a nerve and may be able to reveal the centralized nature of BSC.

Also, politics is a part of everything, whether you think it is or not. Crypto is intensely political in nature... think of the effects it is having and can have on governments across the globe.

I think the idea that politics is icky and needs to be kept separate from other stuff is really quite sad. It results in apathy and reduced political participation, which is pretty antithetical to crypto when you think about it."

For those that don’t know, when the SOPR falls below 1 this means that people are selling at loss. In times of bullish sentiment, the market quickly corrects prices which drive the SOPR value below 1. This is likely due to increased confidence that prices will continue to rise during a bull market, so it would be irrational to sell at a loss when gains are imminent. 

TL;DR - when the SOPR dips below 1 in bull markets, it identifies a good buying opportunity."

gp4jbr7,,Comment,1,0,2021-02-28 00:07:17,"It turned out to be an overhyped shitcoin in jan 2018. All your coins have a huge market cap, meaning its safer but also less likely to grant big returns. I would definetly swap TRX for a potential moonshot, anything with a small market cap, like under 150m."

gp4gwgj,,Comment,1,0,2021-02-27 23:51:49,"Every year a professional team wins the championship. Every year a college team wins the NCAA title. Every year a high school team wins the state crown. All these teams have one thing in common. No matter how tough it became throughout their season, they did one thing—THEY HELD THE ROPE.

What is holding the rope? Imagine that you are hanging from the edge of a cliff with a drop of a thousand feet. The only thing between you and a fall to your death is a rope, with the person of your choice on the other end. Who do you know that has the guts to pull you to safety? Who will hold the rope? Who do you know that is going to let that rope burn their hands and not let go? How many people do you know that are going to withstand the burning pain and watch the blood drip from their hands for you?

If you can name two people, that’s not good enough because those two might not be around. The next time your team is together, look around and ask yourself, who could I trust to hold the rope? Who is going to let their hands bleed for me? When you look at every member on your team or coaches and say to yourself that they would all hold the rope, you are destined to win a lot of games. You see, the team that holds the rope when the going gets tough are winners. When you are down by seven points at the end of the game, don’t give up. Yell at your teammates to hold the rope, let it burn but don’t let go.

Every year there are winners and losers in sports. Every year the winners hold the rope. You don’t have to be the best team on the field to win the game. If you play with poise and do what your coach asks of you, and most of all—HOLD THE ROPE, you will be successful. No matter what sport you play, in order to win, you have to make a commitment to your team. If you are supposed to run three times a week, do it. If you have to lift three times a week, don’t miss. Once you start letting up at practice or start missing your workouts, you’ve killed the team because you didn’t hold the rope.

Don’t let your team down. You’ve got to hold the rope? You must do everything possible both on and off the field to make sure that your teammates know that they can count on you to “HOLD THE ROPE.”

You can even lose to team that has a small amount of star players that carry the team. The other team can have better player material and as long as they don't half-ass the game they'll win. Maybe opposing team has better and more efficient training regimen.
Hard work helps a little, but is not a requirement or guarantee."

Now if you really started ANY positions at the top...of many of these parabolic moves you will get burned.  Don't turn a trade into an investment.  Doing such can take you weeks even months to get back to just break even.  Best to cut losses, hopefully as small as possible, and eye the next entry.

Edit: like right now I'm keeping a keen eye on charts.  A sell off is happening.  I might be looking to nibble a little bit tonight, but I am being cautious that more down side is to come after trading sideways for the last couple days."

Buying small amounts as were dipping is always a solid option, maybe increasing it the lower we go."

lu6e31,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lu6e31/profit_is_made_between_bull_markets_not_during/,"Profit is made BETWEEN bull markets, not DURING bull markets - for newcomers",56,32,2021-02-27 23:41:49,"With some red candles coming in, I sense a bit of panic setting in the crypto community coming from newcomers. I will give some perspective that I wish someone had told me when I first invested years ago.

It’s a story that many of us can probably related to. Hype around coin X, research it, keeps going up, finally bite the bullet and invest, only to see it stagnate and potentially fall.  Cue frustration, despair and panic sell for small to moderate loss.

That’s what I did and I lost money. 

What I didn’t realise, was the history of crypto as a whole. Zoom out the charts. Real profits are NOT made DURING bull markets, they are made BETWEEN bull markets. Bull markets are short lived – generally months and bear markets generally last years. Your ability to profit will depend on two things – open minded research into coins that solve a problem that actually needs solving, and your ability to weather the crypto winter.

We aren’t there yet. 20% drop is a Tuesday. But have no doubt, winter is coming. When it does, your hands will be tested. 

TLDR: profits are made between bull markets, not within them. Invest in long term projects with good fundamentals and only what you can afford to loose."

Im not saying whether it will go up or down but there is a global pandemic, lockdowns, stimulus packages, far less barriers to entry, huge institutional investment, stock market ETF'S and a lot of cryptos actually have functioning products nowadays, especially the defi and NFT sectors.

So to answer your question, now when there is a dip there is a high probability that some institutions would like to buy the dip (before this it was retails investors / whales who manipulate the market).  


So this might reduce the depth of nosedive. However the opposite is also true. Institutions would like to make bank on their investment and take profits as well, so the upwards movement could also get restricted."

buy one BTC at 20....   hodl until 58....happy for 38k profit

What I’ve loved about the internet up until social media the last handful of years was the ability to self regulate absolute idiots to the doldrums. To use scientific reasoning and crowdsourced thought and review to disarm the dumb, backward, or harmful ideologies. 

Lately, none of that has worked it’s just made misinformation the weapon of choice by bad actors. The first thing you do to fight an ideal is to deny the credibility. Misinformation does disarray and discontent. Misinformation weaponized ideology and simple minded meat shields (see capital riots)

So yes, paying for a valuable comment is great. But when Drumpf tweets and his followers give him their money... sad face.

Might want to look into ETF’s like $SPY, $TQQQ, or something like $ARKK

The general rule is that ETF’s go Up.

However, I wouldn't put a ton of trust into an unknown coin. Most are going to fail. The most prominent coins today will likely still be around, although even that's not *guaranteed*, even if I might call it *likely*. The prominent ones aren't going to 100x like the unknown coin might, but they're way more likely to experience growth and still be around.
