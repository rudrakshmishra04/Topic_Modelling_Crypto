It took six months for BTC to surpass its all-time high of almost $65,000 reached in April. Now, with the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price already pushing toward $67,000, market analysts are setting even more bullish price targets.
CoinDesk‚Äôs Damanick Dantes wrote Wednesday that $86,000 might represent the next key price target for bulls, based on a reading of price-chart signals.
‚ÄúAll eyes are set on the $100K mark, but when retail does rush in and more funds open up to bitcoin, including physically backed ETFs, $100K is unlikely to be the end of it,‚Äù Caselin said.
CoinDesk reached out to top market analysts for their insight. Here‚Äôs where they see the market headed."

I started off in 2017 and witnessed the crazy ICO boom! The crazy influx of money, the regulatory roller coaster, the price fluctuations, the craziest predictions, not less than any action movie. The year 2020 saw another trend with the influx of millions of users into the booming DeFi space. With new yield and farming protocols breaking the records of bitcoin, the tectonic shift from CEXs to DEX, the market becomes truly decentralised. Decentralised finance brought a revolution in the financial sector and became the biggest and most successful trend.
Following DeFi, NFT emerged as the next big thing in crypto with the sale of Beeple‚Äôs Everydays: the First 5000 Days JPEG which sold for a whopping $69 million became the headline of every newspaper.~~.~~ We began to see the NFT market breaking every record, but that was only the beginning of the NFT craze.For the people who missed out and didn‚Äôt benefit from those opportunities,  now is the time to prepare yourself for the next big thing in crypto.  
**Who knows what the next big thing in crypto will be?**
* Are there any new uses of the decentralized technology functions today from Ethereum that are worth learning about?
* Maybe there are new dapps directions for cross-chains like Near Protocol, Solana, Polygon?"

hhgbtwo,,Comment,6,0,2021-10-21 00:10:15," I study the nft market as it is important to understand my position.  
Here is a basic summary:  
PFPs with no utility were super ‚Äúhot‚Äù up until about 3 months ago. Then momentum shifted to PFPs that gave secondary drops like BAYK. but utility was the main driver here. However, most NFT flippers are only interested in fast gains, so complex utility took longer to catch on. An example of this is Kongz, who have breeding their own token, which have done extremely well.   
Now enter television. The market is aware of watch to earn, but many of the users of NFTs are still flippers. With [Sator.io](https://Sator.io), I hope people can be encouraged to actually enjoy the utility of NFT‚Äôs rather than flipping them. I believe once this bull market tops out the ones left standing will be the few top dogs, true games and decentralized tv.  
Watch to earn is a powerful new paradigm for streamers and with 4 billion enthusiasts in the world, we do not lack in possible users. The hard part is bringing them into space and getting them adjusted to the new technology."

Go check out the Apex Legends subreddit. Someone got their account hacked...with 8k of skins.
To understand what could happen with Chaingaming really let this sink in. Apex is a first person shooter. Most of your skins are not visible to you. It‚Äôs for other players. People value skins so much they are willing to spend hundreds and thousands on one game.
They can‚Äôt use the skins in other games. When they are bored they never see the skins again. 
It seems crazy that any gaming company would ever allow NFT skins until they realize they can set a royalty rate and earn a portion of the sale every time it is sold.
I also think social tokens will do well.....and if Pok√©mon or Magic the Gathering ever release NFTs my god the sales would freak people out.
There are a few that have the potential to break out.....a Minecraft or Roblox clone would do very well. If you don‚Äôt have kids then maybe this whole Metaverse thing seems like bullshit.

My top 5 holdings are ETH, BTC, AAVE, TEL, and C20, with ADA and ATOM close behind. I recently entered in to lower cap ERG, MTV, CKB, and XPR (Proton) positions off gains from other coins/closing out old positions I lost faith in. 
Curious, what‚Äôs your ‚Äúdown the market cap listing‚Äù coin that you believe in, that has an actual use case, but is under the radar right now?

This is just a reminder that without anyone buying in at the ATH we will never reach a new ATH. Also, the ATH now might be the price you wish you bought in at next year. 
2017 bull run is a good example of this of tons of people not wanting to buy in at 19k-20k price at its peak . Now a days though that would have over x3 your money with your ATH buy and people would kill to buy at that price now a days.

hhgesib,,Comment,6,0,2021-10-21 00:40:31,"TLDR; Notes on my trading and opinions on algo trading signals what I brought last night and all reached TP. Forex led to my crypto balance or to buy in. Crypto and blockchain will never cease to have the ability to learn and grow your or individuals understanding. 
I brought in at yesterdays ATH or close to it. I did so before I went to bed last night also being that I brought my first position of SOL EOS LNK and DOT! All closed over night with Take Profit set for around 3-5%. I set the TP at around $64.6k on BTC buying at $63.7k. Basically set same % range of growth for TP on all the other 7 positions I had set for over night close which were from the above listed and also EOS DOGE and ETH. 
I am still newish to trading crypto Well it‚Äôs been 2 years of study on crypto and blockchain tech in my spare time. I‚Äôm super excited having made now first trades on new currency‚Äôs outside of BTC and ETH and some others like ADA BNB. 
I‚Äôm now learning about many currency‚Äôs stable coins meme coins and or coins or company‚Äôs governance tokens Defi projects and other blockchain tech cryptocurrency types. I had no idea there is like 15 kinds? Or maybe not 15 but Atleast 10 types of crypto! 
The learning is endless and its all amazing thing to learn. From the blockchain tech to stock market terms charting tech analysts economic conditions buyer or consumer use or demand and supply it‚Äôs amazing to have a real chance at finacial freedom.
A note though I wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade this amount and or with the leverage I do or did last night, if it wasn‚Äôt for Forex and the learning in that market and still learning and the gains I made which I have managed to keep above a 70% profit trades and most losses are a lot less than gains. 
Focusing on stopping your losses and how to do so for any position and any trading or investing as opposed to focusing on the Profits is much better for your mind and the profits then come a lot more naturally as you aren‚Äôt as worried about potential losses when you know you will or can only loose xyz amount that you can loose and can risk or is from a gain of yesterday or another day you trade. 
I also never plan to stop trading Forex it‚Äôs my go to when I break even on crypto which only happened a few times when I was not paying enough attention and didn‚Äôt pick up the incoming correction/dip and I sold when I should have held for a the few days or week until I was back at and above what I brought in. I was wanting to trade to much as many new traders do. 
Less is more here Atleast for me it is! As do most recommend and or notice they trade to much when they start or started. That is if  your not already a pro and or not using algo trading software or signals to make your trades for you. Which I have yet to try or set up. I plan to set up signal to an account that I‚Äôm going to put $1,000 into and see how it goes. Will be on a new account that will be seperate to my current account but same exchange. All be it let‚Äôs me. 
Still to me I like to make trades and then set SL and TP and control them myself unlike algo where you set parameters or whatever values to close or make positions close or open new ones. I don‚Äôt like the thought if internet goes and the software needs it or isn‚Äôt run from its own server or while my Internet is out it doesn‚Äôt get effected .. this stuff I don‚Äôt know so I need to learn more on signal trading before I get started there anyway. 
Much to learn and much to share! Sorry if this was to long I hope all understand I am very excited and just want to help others learn that are new like I was 2 years ago to crypto! It‚Äôs never to late!"

qciahv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qciahv/an_entertaining_story_about_how_i_sacrificed/,An entertaining story about how i sacrificed thousands of dollars learning how to scalp/day/swing trade so that you don't have to,16,32,2021-10-20 23:19:09,"Tldr at the bottom.
I've come a long way from the tragedy that I orchestrated the day XRP doubled earlier this year. For some reason fate had it so that the day of this crazy price rise coincided with the day I decided to start my evolution from a risk averse beta HODLer to a risk taking alpha Chad trader. 
I had done no research, no practice, no DD or risk management, I was unreasonably confident (buy low sell high duh) and I thought TA was to nerds what horoscopes are to hot white girls. I somehow managed to perfectly buy the peak of every rise and sell the bottom of every dip. 
At the end of the night the price of xrp had doubled, I had started the night with 6k and ended with the same amount, meaning I had lost half of my XRP making bad and worse trades all night. Had I continued to hold and gone to sleep I would have woken up 6000 dollars richer, more than a quarter of my portfolio (which is also every penny of my life savings) A lesser man met with this same unfortunate instance would probably cut his losses and vow to HODL forever after, but I am even lesser than thatüëΩ
I was so empty and hopeless after that night that I  stopped caring about money altogether and pretty much accepted that my dad was right and I would never amount to anything, I started growing a beard to better assimilate into the homeless community that I would inevitability become apart of. Truly I was humbled by the markets.
This Newfound cynical gloom was actually great for my trading. Before I would panic sell at the first sign of red and FOMO at every green because I was so impatient and my expectations were unrealistic. Any sign of a loss or a missed opportunity would cause me to spin out, It was as if the market controlled me, on green days I would manically fantasize about my future on a yacht full of big booty Latinas and on red days I would Google the best ways to kill myself.
After the XRP incident I started trading like I had nothing to lose, I still had no idea what I was doing but I knew what not to do, and the 6k sunk cost made me adamant to learn, from there I started watching videos and doing research, I finally accepted that TA works (sometimes) and a few months later I cringed at the arrogance of me to think I could trade my way to millionairedom in a few years with nothing other than 20k, 10 fingers, big nuts, and a dream. Turns out it takes a little more than that.
after I got the hang of trading I decided I want to try make a living off it, but I didn't have enough capital to see consistent, substantial returns. I figured  leveraging would be  pretty muchI started margin trading with a goal of securing 100 dollars a day profit on my margin account regardless of market conditions, I changed my mind when I understood risk-reward ratios, which was after I held a BTC long from 59500 down to 56000 and back up to 60000 where I sold for a measly 160$ profit before watching it hit 62300 a few hours later.
Ofc I FOMOd back in at 62300 and panic sold at 61500, only to watch it rise set a new ATH today, but i learned from last time and instead of FOMOing into BTC I moved all my holdings to cross margin and leveraged them 3X to catch some green candles, I secured 800$ profit in a few hours before selling my positions and buying them back in my spot wallet. 
After 10s if not hundreds of bad trades I've started seeing consistent success with my margin trades, it feels good to start reaping the fruits of my labour but I must
In conclusion, margin trading Is a learning curve like anything new. It's risky of course, but even in the case of my so far $8000 investment I think it's worth any price if you manage to stick it out and get the hang of it. Either that or losing so much money in so little time desensitized me to the point I became transfinancial, meaning I'm poor but I identify as a millionaire and conduct my 20,000 dollar life savings as if I have another 5 mil in my chequeing account.
Tldr. If you don't want to end up transfinancial and with PTSD from red candles by the end of your trading journey, you need first to educate yourself and to fortify your mind, trade as if you're playing a game where you try to collect points, but it's not a really fun game so it doesn't matter that much, only enough to try your best but not be dependent on the outcome . This attitude will mitigate bad decisions caused my panic, fear of loss, fomo, etc. 
And remember, if you try your best and lose it all that just means you're stuck working till you die which is the same outcome as if you didn't try at all, so take a risk! Because life is boring without risks, and even if you don't get the outcome you wanted at least you have a story to tell, (how many 21 year olds can say they lost 6000$ in half a day)."

If you ever accidentally or unknowingly add a bad address to the MM it could get drained out by an exploit/hack.
By partitioning your account up you isolate the risk.
All my regularly used protocols that have frequent interaction with MM have dedicated accounts.
Also this is very useful if you are leaving yourself open to Airdrops, especially from less reputed sources, having one with just Airdrop addresses is advantageous.
EDIT: I posted this because I believe partitioning MM is advantageous anyway. I am not advocating people take this step, but have seen it recommended several times recently without this additional caveat. The third word of the post  is 'if' and the post implies that it enters your consideration at a point you've made an adult decision of your own volition. I'm too lazy to make my own no less yours.

Don't worry!",4,29,2021-10-20 23:08:00,"I'm not in crypto for a long time but already went through this like three time, mainly with my ETH. I bought most of my ETH in January this year and then kept buying more. After the May dip I went from over 100% profit to almost 0 profit and that was very painful. At first I thought that the mistake I made was not selling it when I had such a big profit but now I know I did completely different mistake. I should have just buy more and more as that price was on discount.
I'm so glad I haven't sold any of my ETH in the past months. I've been collecting nice interest at the same time so that makes it even sweeter. I know that my biggest regret would be selling even with a 100% profit and then watch the price reach new ATH every day while calculating how much more I could earn if I didn't sell.

I sometimes buy into alts I don‚Äôt see not having great utility but see it having the ability to grow. In other scenarios I‚Äôll get a coin for free.  I‚Äôm sure a lot of you have had this experience. 
Many people (myself included at times) treat their alts as a way to try and make more money which they then use to buy into BTC/ETH. 
Even when I sell alts, I personally hold at least 1 coin (or $1 minimum worth of that coin depending on the value) indefinitely in case it blows up. 
I find doing this deters my FOMO and sellers regret as I still have a small amount of the coin. If the coin flops, I don‚Äôt lose too much but if it goes big over the years at least I‚Äôll make something more than the (hopefully) profit I sold the rest at. 
This is obviously not always the right decision and I‚Äôve missed out on returns, but the volatility of certain alt coins make it impossible to hold super long term 
What other strategies do you use when selling/converting alt coins into fiat or other cryptocurrencies?

Please try posting again with the direct link to the article (You shouldn't see ""amp"" anywhere in the URL) or contact the moderators if you need help.
AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.
It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.
For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

hhg8119,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-20 23:34:23,"For me it was kind of the opposite...             
My ex girlfriend made a bunch of money from drop shipping luxury items purchased abroad in her own country. She made enough money to buy a house off of this, then she discovered leverage trading on the local stock exchange.               
In the final year that we were together, she drove herself 10k USD in to debt. She was gradually withdrawing money from an ATM on her credit card and using that money to pay the minimum balance on her credit card and put money in to the stock exchange futures trading platform at the same time.                   
Our monthly expenses totaled 2300 USD monthly before you account for food. I made about 1900 USD a month after taxes. I begged her to find a simple minimum wage job just so we could make enough money for food. When she finally maxed out her CC debt she just said to me, ""I think I can borrow 850 USD from my family to continue futures trading.""               
1 week later I sold 10 ETH, gave her 3,000 USD, told her that I had paid rent for the month, and I moved in to a new apartment. This was while Eth was still in the lower triple digits, so yes, looking back I lost over 40,000 USD because she didn't want to pull her weight in our home.                 
A friend of mine, who I think has hit millionaire status because housing isn't cheap in any Asian capital city and she says she owns two houses, stopped posting to facebook in 2016, married her husband in 2019, and had a child in 2020, followed the idea of cutting out all social connections.  Her wedding was strictly on paper, and she doesn't buy LV or Gucci. I'd say besides being bored with all of her free time, she might feel somewhat accomplished. But if people find out you have a large amount of money, eventually they will ask for some kind of help. More money more problems. Less friends, less problems."

I honestly would love to see this take off because it is the biggest thing dragging my portfolio down since I got it when it was 21 cents. But until the extreme manipulation stops. There is no way of knowing where the price really is going to go in the long run.

To be blunt, I think when the manipulation stops, I think we could see this bounce easily. But as far as how high depends. I hope at least 50 cents or more."

hhg1z2j,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-20 22:42:57,"I watched this video today. VeChain is has biggest % in my portfolio.
I didn't take the profits in May, which was dubm since I was almost x2 good on my initial investment.
There was a lot of hype that it will reach $1, now this guy is talking about $1.32. Which is amazing IMO, and I would really like to believe this but for now I think that it is not possible.
The lowest price could be of $0.15 in his opinion, which is also good. Good but not great.
My conclusion is that there is no way we will see $1.32 in this bull run.
On the long term however that is quite possible.
I strongly believe in this project even when it is not doing good.
VeChain team is a great, transparent, hardworking team and the projects and partnerships that they made is something that we should all respect.
For example just take a look how their blockchain technology can help reduce carbon emissions.
Any enterprise in this world would only benefit for using the technology behind VeChain."

hhgpw2g,,Comment,2,0,2021-10-21 02:58:14,"VeChain staff spend the majority of their efforts in establishing misleading partnerships - 90% are not paid partnerships. **They are in the bussiness of selling tokens to retail** \- people need to wake the fu\*k up.
They don't have global office as they say - all their locations if you look into it are co-working spaces that they rent 1-2 office desks (except their main China location), there is no contact telephone (a company that claims to work with some of the biggest brands in the world don't have an address/telephone numbers in its website(!)).
Their blockchain is centralised (you need a KYC and approval to run a node), 100% of tokens were premined (they also have one of the largest supplies around) enough to dump on retail for as long as they will be buying the ""real world usage"" narrative that they produce and broadcast through various channels. Look at any crypto related website introducing VeChain, any post in social, reddit etc.. What you will find is the EXACT same copy. As I said, they control the narrative tightly.
I dare anyone to go any website.. BMW, Bayer, PwC and search for VeChain. There will be 0 results. All announcements are from VeChain's side and only. Send an email to any of these brands - ask for more information about the partnership specifics - you will be amazed by the replies.
Anyone who has worked in a consultancy knows how these deals and partnerships can be smoke & mirrors. The majority are VeChain taking part in some sort of proof of concept, some sort of memorandum of understanding and/or paying compensation to high ups in various brands to sort out announcements.
VeChain did good with this strategy in the previous cycle, but I strongly believe this will be their last. Retail is getting smarter and more educated - thus the slow price. This is not 2018."

qchd5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qchd5o/47_days_until_first_elastos_halving/,47 Days Until First Elastos Halving,16,25,2021-10-20 22:28:56,"Is anyone else paying attention to the fact that there is less than 50 days until the first Elastos block reward halving? 
The deflationary tokenomics of Elastos (ELA) make this alt one to watch, especially as we get closer to the day that the block rewards get reduced from 3 to 1.5 ELA. Similar to Bitcoin, Elastos will have halvings every 4 years after this, massively increasing the scarcity of the already scarce token. With only a max supply of 28,220,000 ever being in circulation (last one to be mined in 2105) things will start to get interesting soon.
Ela is used on the web 3.0 Elastos ecosystem, and is secured by Bitcoin miners. Currently nearly 60% of all bitcoin miners are merge mining Elastos at no extra cost and receiving Elastos as a reward, thus making ELA one of the most secure networks in all of crypto. It is infinitely scaleable via its infinite sidechains which are secured by proof of stake.
Does this token really deserve its ranking on CMC of 400+ or will the halving drive a massive increase in price and awareness? It survived and developed non stop sincd the bear market in 2018, but is still a long way off its ATH."

When too many people want to sell for the same price for example at $70k, they build a resistance wall which is kind of hard to break trough.  
To avoid those resistance walls vary a little with the numbers in a range of 5%.  
For example, if you want to sell for $70k, put a sell order between $68k-$72k and make sure the last digits doesn't end with zeros.  
It's tempting but you should also avoid selling for $69,420 as this number is quite popular and most likely a resistance wall."

It's been getting worse over the past few weeks and finally the last few days i've had no service the entire time.

First option, use that chunk to pay off my student loan - I have a loan of around 19k, and are currently paying minimum amount plus a couple bucks monthly right now. Personally, I feel like I have no need to rush paying off the entire loan right now, but am thinking maybe that‚Äôs the smart financial move? Second option, use that chunk to lump sum bitcoin + ether - the rate of appreciation in crypto assets will probably exceed the loan rate in student loan 5 or 10 years down the road. Third option, use that chunk to DCA in bitcoin + ethereum - I‚Äôm already dcaing now with my current salary, so if I am to do this, I would just DCA more each month. Thoughts?
Edit: For context, I‚Äôm early 20s and the loan rate is 7%
Edit 2: For more context, I won‚Äôt receive the bonus until February next year, so if I‚Äôm to DCA/lump sum crypto, I won‚Äôt do that until then

You're not obliged to pay off the loan immediately so why not take your time. It is so easy to get >7% profit in crypto investment which means it will definitely cover the interest of the loan and you can stake your crypto for compound interest.
hhpthp5,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-23 02:45:28,"You‚Äôre basically asking what will perform better.
The safe bet is paying down the loan.
Stock Market sentiment is in a weird place.  Everything (at least ETF/major indexes/ tech) seems overvalued and has been for a couple years.  However CoVid caused most governments to print money and push inflation.  Couple this with supply chain constraints and the economy is pumping.  Stocks may need to go up to adjust for all this madness.
If you want to be a degenerate gambler, dump it into crypto.
Personally I‚Äôd pay down the loan.
Also if you have a chunk of cash, lump sum beats DCA.  DCA assumes you don‚Äôt have a pile of money, and part of your paycheck is buying every week.  Lump some is dumb if you‚Äôre saving $10,000 and buying once per year.  Time in the market beats timing the market.  The best time to buy is always today.
Basically when I started, I ‚Äúlumped sum‚Äù invested everything I saved.  Then DCA ever since."

hhq64pd,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-23 05:54:23,"Your debt in fiat depreciates every day. And you won't get any discount for paying it off earlier. As a matter of fact, you will usually be penalized.
For example, I am currently paying an 8-year loan, which I could already pay off with my crypto profits. But early payment incurs a 1% penalty. Ridiculous, I know. Welcome to modern ""banking""!
Also, why would I want to pay now, when we all know that 1 dollar today is worth easily 1.5 dollars of 2028? Think about tye things you could buy with 1000 bucks 8 years ago, and the milleage you get today. And it's just getting worse.
So no, you want to drag ever-depreciating fiat loans for as long as possible in fact -- while accumulating ever-appreciating (at least for the next 10-15 years) crypto.
Now, a similar reasoning works on your DCA question. Why DCA in small sums, when you know that in the long run the trend goes up? You want to be a bit careful about the specific moment you throw in the lump sum of course. Try to find a deep. But even if you bought at the peak, it's likely that eventually you get a higher return than DCAing.
Also, ignore the ""you should diversify"" crew. If you have concluded (correctly) that crypto is a good investment that outperforms any other known asset class, why malinvest on purpose? That's not being cautious, but being incompetent.
Diversifying into low or even negative yield assets sounds like the type of eccentricity millionaires can afford, not young working people with no assets who are trying to generate and protect generational wealth starting from 4 or 5 figures."

Think of it like this, there's almost 8 billion people on earth, out of those only 0.00003% are billionaires, according to my questionable maths skills and looking it up on google.   
Think about it, crypto is busy rising, these people have so much money they'll never have to work again nor any of their family, they live a life separately from the rest of us that has to pay bills. They probably don't even know what milk costs or how much they spend on power.   
Average people are making money and getting rich on crypto, ask yourself why are these billionaires in crypto if not the money? Take from it what you will, in my view they laugh at the average crypto investor.

Because cave men didn't have billionaires. You cant whip 1800s peasants into making computers or rockets or insulin. What is money worth if all you can buy is different kinds of dirt and dead animals? What is your retirement fund worth if you destroyed the genetic heritage of your planet?
What I'm saying is, Don't be shocked when you sell crack and live next to crackheads.
Lots of billionaires realize these things and take joy in making the world a better place.
But more do not.
Likely because the people who have become rich are for the most part just lucky.
Its a lot easier investing in yourself when you're not starving, undereducated or oppressed by basic poverty. Its also a lot easier to inherit billions than it is to earn them.
Einstein wouldn't have been Einstein if he malnutrition or lead poisoning.
People tell themselves they've ""earned"" their lot in life because they need that to be true. For their identity, for their insecurity, to excuse their selfishness or to hide the crippling truth that no one is in control. (not even elon)
This leads to a huge disparity and has essentially defined the meaning of human life for the last 400 years of human culture. We're addicts its never enough, it makes the world go around, hell we'll kill ourselves for it.
And for what? A car? a house? eternal life? what are you really going to buy today with a billion dollars. Admit it... the first things you thought of, cave men had.
Land, A home, food security, safety.  Funny isn't it? With the exception of show off money (say riding a penis shaped rocket into the back yard of our world with some actors for fun) greed and fear are much stronger motivators than we as living being need. Jeff might think he's king shit but from a cosmic perspective he's just another ape whos never left the zoo.
Mine,mine,mine. Like kids who don't want to go home, kick and scream but BIGDADDY time takes us all eventually.
Lets get rich, but not build monoliths to our penis. (that includes private themeparks)
Lets get rich and make history."

qdx031,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdx031/one_day_my_portfolio_was_down_99_today_i_broke/,"One day my portfolio was Down 99%, Today I broke even. Now I feel like a genius.",12,37,2021-10-22 23:36:17,"2 days ago I realized I was still down 99%.   So I grabbed a pencil, and paper to calculate exactly How much I really was down.      I went onto my banking app to print out transaction history, wrote down exactly how much USD I initially invested, stared at the number for a little bit then mediated to bring back memories of how much I valued USD at the time I bought in. 
A few minutes later, I recalled the memory.  I didn't think USD was worth shit at the time.  In fact I was disgusted about how much value it lost.   I felt it was really worth 1 penny for each dollar.  
So really, I invested 99 times less than what the amount was.      However, when I woke up today, my perspective completely changed.  I now value 1 US dollar to be equal to 1 US dollar.    
 That means I invested at a time where 1 USD was barley worth 1 penny to me.  So if I cash out today, 1 USD is now worth 1 USD.    So I'm not really down 99%.  I broke even. 
See how easy it is to regain your loss? You only have to change your perception of the dollar's value and compare it with the value you perceived it as at the time of initial investment."

hhpacp0,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-22 23:07:51,"I prefer the term play-to-own instead of play-to-earn.
If you‚Äôre just trying to make money, you need to approach it very differently - and most people will just have a bad time.
But you can play games like Gods Unchained (TCG) or Lost Relics (RPG) today - and earn items that you own.
Axie Infinity is the only real play-to-earn game that has a sustainable economy, and where you can invest those amounts with some certainty of yield.
But it‚Äôs all super early and everything is still quite experimental! It‚Äôs a great time to get involved and start learning."

Now, this of course does not excuse or smooth over any of the bad shit, but at the very least Pakistan is trying. Which is more than what can be said for some other developing countries.   
 Your comment is based on your one dimensional, view that was most likely based on sensational negative news reports. Which is why, you most likely do not know about good news coming out of Pakistan, like the billion tree tsunami: [https://tribune.com.pk/story/2324493/green-jobs](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2324493/green-jobs)  
So I urge you to re-evaluate your one dimensional view of a nation that is most likely based on sensationalism and not the full reality.   
Or at the very least not make banal comments on unrelated topics."

We all know that it is the most safe and secure privacy coin in the world right now, so why is it still many hundreds off its ATH?
Whereas other coins such as Eth, Sol, Btc continue to skyrocket, Monero remains the same in price. It's quite puzzling because when you look at use cases, it ticks all the boxes (anti-government, true decentralization, true privacy), however its barely getting any traction right now.
Is everyone planning to jump ship in the coming years into Monero, or does it need more development? Really want to know, because everyone continues to mention privacy, transaction costs/fees, 'rug pulls', but the traction for XMR just isn't there, regardless of the use cases. 
Are we waiting on institutions to *accept* XMR?

As far as i am aware it is not actually illegal, however, regulators will force exchanges to submit to a very strict regular auditing process when AUD and XMR are on an exchange and almost all of the exchanges offering services to Australians have stopped selling XMR to us.
XMR is getting more difficult to buy without using a site like [tradeogre.com](https://tradeogre.com) and I think the vast majority of investors are on a major exchange and won't even look into projects that aren't on coinbase or binance...

hhpau9v,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-22 23:12:26,"you want a real, honest, unpopular answer?
monero is like torrents. there are big chances governments will close in on it to make it illegal (or as illegal as they can, like they did with torrents). it starts with small lawsuit here and there, and slowly things get harder.
this scares investors. people know how these things go: if a system is used for illegal things, no matter the legal basis: they will twist and change the law until it is illegal.
And from a crypto-community future perspective: most people don't want complete privacy. The main game-changer with crypto has always been that, once it was globally adopted, we would finally be able to see the money coming in and out of the accounts of politicians, banks and governments. so that people can, for example, see if taxes collected for education aren't being spent on the military instead.
so the real challenge is not if monero will have a future, but if we as a society find a way to allow privacy and accountability to co-exist in a society in which people have to pay taxes. on one hand we want privacy, on the other we need to be able to check if some rich people aren't bending the rules. once we find a way to solve that, then cryptos like Monero have a MUCH better future.
so stop asking ""is monero going to have a future?"" and start asking ""HOW could a monero future look like?"". 
For example (just a dumb example to make my point) maybe the solution would be some new form of tax system: maybe, instead of taxing income, we just tax products purchased. that would leave rich people with a huge advantage though, since they earn much more than they spend, and spend much outside the country. this would lead to poor people paying % more taxes in the country than rich people. also, what would happen to digital goods in that format? would spotify exist in the cloud and pay taxes to no country?"

Try to buy a house, ground, car etc with Monero....
As long as governments are involved in such transactions and they demand to know where the money is coming from, really private coins like Monero are a pain in the ass..
There are more reasons but this one is the biggest factor for Monero to not become as adopted as some would like it to be.
We can discuss if governments should have this power and be able to use it this way, but the fact they do is limiting the usage of Monero."

hhq49ak,,Comment,-1,0,2021-10-23 05:25:29,"Please think about it or just try it...
With Monero there is no link possible to where the money came from, with Bitcoin if you want to, buying via an official exchange, one can easily proof a link to the fiat source.
Buying a house with cash I'm not even going to discuss, sorry..
Bitcoin can be hard linked to the fiat source and that makes it possible your bank will accept your bitcoin deposit, through an exchange, or an official party to accept a Bitcoin payment as long as you can proof your source and the legality of your money. Depending on your jurisdiction you would have to pay taxes on possible made gains.
Monero simply cuts this link permanently, nice for privacy, not so nice when you have to proof the origin of your wealth.
And NO it won't be accepted that you can show you deposited $100k at some exchange and have that same amount in Monero, you could do that many times for just one deposit since there is no hard link possible.
If you would go this way with Monero you would have to officially document the fiat transaction into monery with an official third party  this obviously destroys any privacy, rendering the advertised advantage of Monero useless."

* In January Bitcoin traded at $7200  
* In March it was down by 30% and traded at $5000 (People who bought it at 5000 I am jealous xD).  
* In May it was Bitcoin halving & BTC price soar to $9800$  
* By the year end it traded $29000 (yes that's just insane)  
* So it saw a growth of 300% just in year 2020.
2021:  
2021 was best year for BTC.  
 
* In January itself it touched $40k.  
* In February it crossed $50k mark(Elon Musk also shown keen interest in Crypto and tweeted his opinion around it)  
* In April BTC recorded ATH at $64k  
a really amazing time or it was silence before the storm  
* In May BTC crashed by 50% (China's Ban, Tesla not accepting BTC, FUD)
* In September it rose again to $50k in span of 3 month it mostly recovered from crash.
* In October BTC recorded next ATH of $66.5k.  
* So this year BTC growth is 60% till October
And from start of 2020 BTC growth is massive 825%.  
There is huge history of BTC but even this 2 years of timeline is amazing to watch and shows what is the potential of holding a coin for long term.

what the majority of people dont know because they're too new to crypto is bitcoin had a bug that created billions of btc and needed a soft fork. also had a hard fork where someone was able to double spend a huge amount and the network was saved by a [single pool owner that had large enough hash rate and it all took place in a single irc server.](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/07/28/analyzing-the-2013-bitcoin-fork-centralized-decision-making-saved-the-day/)

qdvsnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvsnd/lets_discuss_what_goes_into_building_an_exchangea/,"Lets discuss what goes into building an exchange(A Planning, Features, Funding, Obligations, Legal Requirements and Development Discussion for all to learn from)",1,5,2021-10-22 22:18:35," A preface for this post: It is not my intent to discuss any current issues or political stuff involving cryptocurrency, only to discuss what goes into building them for learning purposes only. My knowledge of crypto is also somewhat limited but I have done a small bit of research prior to making this post.
&#x200B;
So let us dive into the topic I wanted to discuss. For the past couple of years, I've started in crypto using Binance and Coinbase to trade various cryptocurrencies with a bot provided by 3commas and then funnel cash into my PayPal using Coinbase as a middle man. Later on, I was forced to use Binance US when they told all US citizens to move over to that site and ended up using my bank for withdrawing cash into my bank to use.
&#x200B;
But while I don't have ANY major issues with using Binance or Coinbase I've seen a lot of people running into various problems, stuff that one exchange has that the other doesn't, and also different requirements between them. Seeing these differences made me wonder, what brought them to the decisions they made? What about their platform determines how things are handled in the background? What are the obligations these two companies have to deal with not just to their users but also with the governments those citizens live in, legally speaking? What goes into creating an exchange platform from the very begining?
&#x200B;
I'm going to be upfront, I only know a few things about exchanges and only from a user perspective. 90% of my activity has also been handled by a bot that is managed by somebody I have a lot of trust in to handle it for me. So my own knowledge is mostly what I've pieced together over the last two years. 
&#x200B;
So things I felt worth discussing would be:
1. Before even building the platform, what is needed to facilitate trades being done on a platform? (Funding, Features, Payment Processing, etc)
2. When building an exchange what is typically needed for supporting various coins on an exchange? (contract with the creators of coins/tokens, is it just making the software use it, etc)
3. When building an exchange what features should be considered important and what should be optional?
4. What are the legal requirements of the exchange? (Basically what is required other than paying your taxes in order to run an exchange in either the US, EU, or anywhere that people know these laws/regulations)
5. What potential incidents could an exchange end up facing and how to attempt to avoid legal or financial problems arising from them?
6. Another interesting topic would be what goes into building the software that runs these exchanges? (In dept coding stuff, I have some prior experience with software development and this also highly interests me the most)
&#x200B;
I hope this discussion can help people with little to no knowledge about exchanges better understand how they operate and start out, and that possibly others can create their own exchange thanks to better understanding and possibly improve upon other ideas from this discussion.
&#x200B;
NOTE: Moderators please let me know if any portion of this discussion may be against the subreddit rules. I did check through the rules and didn't see anything against the stuff above but if I'm mistaken I'll gladly edit my post. My only intent here is for learning and for others to learn more about crypto exchange platforms and how they operate."
hhp8cla,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-22 22:48:14,"1. Super good order matching engine. API access. In house market marking. Deposit and withdrawals of basic coins or fiat.
2. Custodians or in some cases you are your in-house custodians. Big exchanges custody their own some use 3rd party. You need to have a generalised interface and API, multisig private key management.
3. The exchange itself and probably its GUI
4. No idea but if you are aiming for US market it is damn complicated. The bigger you are the more compliant you are needed before you are kicked out.
5. Hacks, breaches, wrongfully sending their own money to the void. You‚Äôve seen it when exchanges made mistakes with blockfi.
6. Not sure but it is very deep. You need to have a highly efficient software to facilitate high frequency trades."
hhp8mo9,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-22 22:50:42,"I just wanted to say that there are no experts in here that could help you. As we are just normal people that discuss crypto at a superficial level.
I don't think someone with knowledge to answer all of your questions would spend the time in the sub anyways.
I would love for it to not be like that, but it is what It is."
hhpbwl1,,Comment,1,0,2021-10-22 23:22:49,"It's funny - I have access to a very wealthy older investor who has carte blanche told me that he'd back any crypto project I want to start and I've actually looked into starting a CEX pretty seriously. Because all of my research was funded by his money I don't feel comfortable sharing it but it's a much bigger project than most people (including me when I got started) would imagine and we decided to put it on the backburner until one of our other projects with higher priority gets off the ground. 
To me it seems like there is no CEX that offers low fees, great customer service and an interesting slate of coin pair offerings to US-based customers and that is a niche that needs filling imo."

It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual,
A step-by-step booklet for you to get,
Your game on track, not your rug pulled back,
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know,
How much crypto you hold, cause you know,
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If you fucked up, get yo' seed jacked up,
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move,
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and have boating accidents?,
Take it from your highness,
I done squeezed mad dips, examined market caps and coins that flip,
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy
Your favourite coin class hyped up, fees properly gassed up,
Robinhood and metamasked up, shit, for that fast buck,
They be down, claiming maintenance, when your ass up,
Number 4, I know you heard this before
Never buy at all time high to boost your supply
Number 5, never day trade, stick to what you best at,
I don't care if they want you to leverage, tell 'em never bitch!,
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it
Are you a crackhead? Flash crash? paying it back? shit forget it!,
7, this rule is so underrated,
Keep your family and crypto completely separated,
Coins and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch,
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8, never keep no seeds on you!
Them cats that squeeze your coins, can run scams too,
Number 9, shoulda been Number 1 to me,
If you ain't holding bags stay the fuck away from VET
You think Coinbase listing? they ain't trying to listen
They be SHIBin, with VET they on the pot and not shittin'
Number 10, a strong word called sentiments,
Dead for veterans, but not for freshmen
If you ain't got the intel, then say ""hell no!"",
'Cause they charts gonna move, rain, sleet, hail, snow,
Follow these rules, you'll have made coins to stake up,
And still check the charts religiously when you wake up,
Pump hit your wallet, watch your FOMO shake up,
DCA‚Äôing trying to makeup, from the dip you passed,
you and crypto wanna break up every three weeks,
Wishing you picked a whole half of CAKE up,
Heard it‚Äôll pump, it‚Äôs sick, and can hook a stake up,
Gotta go, gotta go, more shitcoins to make up, word up"

This law firm likely doesn't have much experience dealing with these sorts of cases. First of all, they sued the SEC under the Fourteenth amendment's due process clause. The proper due process clause is the Fifth amendment. The Fourteenth amendment is applicable to the states, not the federal government. 
To bring constitutional claims against an agency, you can bring the claim under the Administrative Procedure Act, but to bring constitutional claims directly under Bivens you have to bring the suit against the secretary of the agency. They didn't name the secretary in this lawsuit. 
There's also a lot of issues with the case as it relates to justiciability. The case is likely not ripe.
In sum, this case might not make it out of the pleading stage."

qdvm2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvm2i/ethereum_l2_scaling_is_here_you_dont_need_to_wait/,"Ethereum L2 Scaling is Here, You Don't Need to Wait For ETH2",14,50,2021-10-22 22:07:19,"Ethereum Scaling is always a contentious issue, but I believe it's often brought up mainly to discredit Ethereum rather than highlight a problem. At 49 gwei gas right now I wanted to bring up some ideas and mention the various scaling solutions Ethereum has. Check out [https://l2fees.info/](https://l2fees.info/) for information on the exact costs once you bridge over.
True L2s
**Optimistic Rollups**
Optimistic Rollups are a scaling technology that relies on people disproving transactions rather than proving this. Thanks to this and tx batching as well as some off chain processing transactions become much cheaper and the chain only has to spend time fully processing contested transactions. A true pain in the ass to move tokens off though, which is why I personally like zk snarks more, but to each their own and Optimistic just sounds so happy its hard to resist.
Arbitrum is the main implementation of Optimistic Rollups, at roughly $15 per coin to move on, and less for ETH, its a great option to move your coins over to. Platforms like Sushiswap, Uniswap, Aave, CREAM, and others have already moved over so if you want to start farming your sick yield farming gains you can hop on over right now and do everything you would want to do on Ethereum Mainnet but cheaper.
Optimism, believe it not, does Optimistic Rollups. Its already supported by Chainlink, Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound. You can do everything to your hearts desire here with fees that work out to less than Arbitrum\* (fees not comparable as speeds are throttled during beta)
**ZkSnarks**
Zksnarks is math. It uses math to scale things, there are like 6 University papers you can read if you are really interested, but I am not going to throw math here that neither of us understand and call it an explanation. Obligatory Zero Knowledge Proof to cover buzzwords
Zksync is the main implementation of this technology, and while they haven't seen as much adoption as others their fees are dirt cheap, they are battle-tested at this point and proven to be secure. They are bit harder to code for though, so make sure to petition your favorite platforms to move over! ZkSnarks are amazing and deserve more attention.
Loopring totally forgot about them, sorry! They are really cool and you should use them. ZkSnarks are insanely secure, wicked fast, and proven. There is a DEX, and I think there is a Lender but couldn't find anything online, please let me know if there is.
**Commit Chains**
Chains that are full standalone chains that submit checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet. They don't benefit from Ethereum's security but can also have their own benefits of high throughput and compatbility.
Polygon, its just Polygon. Pretty much everything has a Polygon deployment from 88mph to Aave to Sushiswap to even native protocols like Quickswap.
Tl;Dr - Don't wait for ETH2! Make the L2 Jump today and start yield farming and decentralizing finance. Take this post as the kick to get you to actually log into that website, click the ""move to l2"" button, pay $30, and enjoy a whole new world!
If I missed any platforms please let me know!"

hhpnfw8,,Comment,3,0,2021-10-23 01:24:37,The point here is that there are solutions to high gas fees available in the form of Layer 2.
hhp5b7a,,Comment,3,0,2021-10-22 22:21:28,Its cheap on L2 then you can go from l2 to l2. Converting back to mainnet is a tad expensive but atleast in my case I don't plan to return to L1 until ETH2 when it can be done cheaply
hhpnhpq,,Comment,3,0,2021-10-23 01:25:15,"That should only need to be done once, though. Or not at all if you buy tokens from exchanges that can direct-deposit to a layer 2."
hhqbl9z,,Comment,3,0,2021-10-23 07:11:59,"Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com already provide ways to withdraw directly into an L2, actually. 
The principle is for end users to use only L2s. The L1 only is a technical layer for security, so that L2s can roll up their blocks into the L1 and keep being as secure as the L1 all while being way cheaper and faster to use.
As more and more people use L2s rather than the L1, transactions will become even cheaper."

And when I say anything, I mean literally ANYTHING. This is up to and including buying/swapping on DEXs using eth ... When 2.0 comes out, ethereum is going to blow up bigger than Chernobyl. But until then, you have to go around your elbow to get to your asshole to make it even semi useful. That's why I didn't read the 53 paragraph page about why l2 is good...

I kind of wonder how it would work out if we ever get a spot price ETF. If it has the potential gains of holding crypto but the tax/retirement benefits of stocks it would make sense to invest in that. But would it cause people to stop buying/divest their actual crypto holdings and put it into the ETF? I'm not sure what kind of effect that would have on the crypto market."

It‚Äôs not really a significant reason to choose a chain and doesn‚Äôt really make it easier to launch a dApp. If all the tooling is for Solidity - just learn Solidity, it‚Äôs not too hard. 
What will be most interesting is that zk based roll ups can deploy a range of interesting variations including Fuel with a Rust based UTXO approach and Starknet with Cairo, for example. So we‚Äôll hopefully start to see what you‚Äôve described, but with deeper ecosystem support for each.

qdvdpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvdpp/im_considering_selling_my_ada_for_avax/,I'm considering selling my ADA for AVAX,22,89,2021-10-22 21:52:56,"I do love ADA but I fear the upsides won't be as profitable during this current cycle as its already near the top of the totem pole. I can see it easily getting to $4 or maybe $5 but that's only 2x potential. I'm purely looking at this from a profit perspective.
AVAX has a much lower cap and has tons of hype around it. The fundamentals sound great.
Going from 65 to 130 just means getting a market cap of 30b, SOL has 60b and ADA has 70b.  For ADA to go to 4 that means 140b. 
So it seems FAR more realistic to 2x on AVAX.
In fact if ADA were to 2x, for AVAX to grab its same capitalization of 79b it would 8x to about $300.  I totally feel that's reasonable!
Question is should I wait for the last big dip before the real run up? Historically that'll happen. Or just buy a HODL...
Also, if another coin has similar fundamentals let me know. I really don't want to miss an obvious play.
For example, you guys keep talking about ONE... Would ONE be smarter than AVAX?
Thanks!"
