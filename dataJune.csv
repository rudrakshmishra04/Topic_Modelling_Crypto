It’s becoming very apparent Jay Clayton went ahead with this lawsuit prematurely and without concluding an investigation. The guy literally did it on his last day.
The court has ordered the SEC to hand over documents regarding Eth and BTC twice and they still haven’t done it. The sec is starting to look like a complete embarrassment. But ripples fair notice defence is where they can win at summary judgment. 
The sec had 8 years to bring the case forward. They had 8 years to help crypto but instead Jay Clayton filed the lawsuit on the last day. Ripple are now saying they did not have fair notice. The SEC sat on their hands and didn’t assist crypto in anyway. If ripple win the fair notice defence that means the SEC cannot go after the OG cryptos. They fucked up, by sitting aside and doing nothing they have essentially dug their own grave."

1) what are the documents they're talking about. 
There are supposed to be 30k docs mentioning BTC 17k mentioning ETH and 9k with XRP or Ripple In them. Ripple knows they exist because Mary Jo White is general counsel for Ripple and was a SEC chairman for the majority of the time since Ripple's tolling agreement which they've had in place since 2013 when Fincen sued Ripple then fined them and recognized them as a currency transmitter an xrp as a currency. It's something to note that Fincen and the SEC are pretty much the same organization now in 2021.
>2) why is the sec interested in ripple
The SEC is interested in Ripple because they believe that they can set precedent in this case that will allow them to regulate Decentralized assets and most notably all exchanges allowing access to Decentralized assets
3) what court case / preceding is this in regards too? 
The SEC vs Ripple case is the most important thing going on in the crypto space at the moment. This will define legal precedent for crypto assets in the US."
h0phpzf,,Comment,7,0,2021-06-05 13:41:47,"The SEC is suing Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, and Chris Larsen, arguing their past sales of XRP are in fact illegal sales of unregistered securities. The documents Ripple's lawyers are seeking are internal correspondence regarding whether or not the SEC viewed BTC and ETH to also be securities. It's relevant because Ethereum's creators also held a sale of ETH similar to what Ripple did with XRP and yet the SEC was seemingly fine with that."

h0q2e78,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-05 16:35:23,"The SEC is the American Exchange Commission. Their job is supposedly to protect American investors in any market. In this case, they are going after Ripple because the last chairman literally pushed the case through on his last day in office knowing that he wouldn't have to deal with the fallout. The SEC is now desperately trying to argue that the sale of Ripple's XRP tokens constitute securities sales according to the outdated Howie test. The vast majority of SEC cases are settled with a fine, but in this case, Ripple has both the means and strong case to fight them on it. Not to mention the fact that Ripple is one of the few massive crypto companies that has done more than any other to appease the regulators and get regulatory clarity the entire crypto space desperately needs, and a global company like Ripple needs to be able to properly function in the United States.  
It's literally only in the US that the SEC is argueing that XRP is a security. Both the UK treasure and Japan's version of the SEC have come to the contrary conclusion. Many other countries too. But the former head of the SEC either didn't agree or wanted to screw over the next administration by pushing this case forward and now the SEC is trying to save face. But so far, Ripple seems to be winning at every turn.  
On a larger scale, the outcome of this would both give Ripple the regulatory clarity it's been after for years, but would also provide the entire crypto space with a prescedent and clarity they can follow to get the same regulatory green light in the US, which is one of the biggest markets in the world.  
In short, if Ripple wins, this will be fantastic for the entire crypto space, and amazing for Ripple and their XRP token.

h0ntef5,,Comment,-6,0,2021-06-05 02:55:20,The case has not yet been argued. And it’s mostly an on-paper case anyway. Ripple has very low odds of winning this case.
h0q21un,,Comment,6,0,2021-06-05 16:32:30,"The SEC is the American Exchange Commission. Their job is supposedly to protect American investors in any market. In this case, they are going after Ripple because the last chairman literally pushed the case through on his last day in office knowing that he wouldn't have to deal with the fallout. The SEC is now desperately trying to argue that the sale of Ripple's XRP tokens constitute securities sales according to the outdated Howie test. The vast majority of SEC cases are settled with a fine, but in this case, Ripple has both the means and strong case to fight them on it. Not to mention the fact that Ripple is one of the few massive crypto companies that has done more than any other to appease the regulators and get regulatory clarity the entire crypto space desperately needs, and a global company like Ripple needs to be able to properly function in the United States.
It's literally only in the US that the SEC is argueing that XRP is a security. Both the UK treasure and Japan's version of the SEC have come to the contrary conclusion. Many other countries too. But the former head of the SEC either didn't agree or wanted to screw over the next administration by pushing this case forward and now the SEC is trying to save face. But so far, Ripple seems to be winning at every turn.
On a larger scale, the outcome of this would both give Ripple the regulatory clarity it's been after for years, but would also provide the entire crypto space with a prescedent and clarity they can follow to get the same regulatory green light in the US, which is one of the biggest markets in the world.
In short, if Ripple wins, this will be fantastic for the entire crypto space, and amazing for Ripple and their XRP token.

Also I really don’t care about downvotes. Sadly disagreements are not met with arguments and ideas, just emotional responses.
People could take a moment to really evaluate XRP. It’s distribution was centralised and the nodes are picked by Ripple themselves. SEC was able to go after them exactly because of the centralisation. It was designed for banks and governments to use as international payment system, not for the people. XRP is part of my stash but my motivation is only speculation.
The reason I cheer for Ripple in courts is because I hate to see ignorant bureaucrats going after developers and projects, even if I disagree with the development..."

Yes, Ripple is a company.
Yes, they have a CEO.
I never claimed otherwhise.
But where did Ripple claim that XRP is their exclusive property? Any source to back that up? Kinda strange they encourage other parties to build on the xrp ledger then, no? Xumm, Coil, CSC, Flare Network,... all built around/on the xrp ledger... Free to use, as the open source crypto it is. Heck, when Ripple's CTO David Schwarz wants to make an adjustment to the xrp protocol, he has to file a proposal like every other mortal and it has to be approved by 80% of validators for at least 2 weeks. Kinda strange if they own xrp as it's exclusive property, no?
It's very easy to claim that XRP is not a product of Ripple. Ripple sells 'Ripplenet' as a product, which can use xrp if the client wants to. You can check their product page on their website: https://ripple.com/ripplenet 
You seem to mistake 'uses' the entire xrp network versus 'owns' the entire xrp network. Look at the long list of different validators, including (and not limited to) universities around the world, xrp fans and yes, Ripple also has nodes running. Heck, even the SEC has (or had) an xrp node: https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/07/30/sec-to-run-bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-nodes
https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/validators
If tomorrow Ripple goes bankrupt, the xrp ledger will still work. Xumm will still work, Coil will still work and the Flare Network (when live) will work. As many, many other projects will, running on the xrp ledger."

h0nadqm,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-04 23:14:53,"So umm a lot of people use Bitcoin to buy other coins. This is important because that means the value of Bitcoin is then connected to the price of the other coins. Also people use trading bots that kinda have the same principle? So the bots base their trades off of Bitcoin. 
Also declines in Bitcoin price reflect general sentiment on crypto as a whole, so when Bitcoin declines people anticipate a decline in other crypto that they hold and so they sell them in response"
h0nbti1,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-04 23:28:27,"Ok, thank you. If I understand correctly it seems there are many factors that play into the market as a whole but the biggest factor I'm overlooking is the store value effect of bitcoin.
I just assumed other coins would gain on BTC value everytime there was a dip if people sold only their bitcoin."
h0ncy32,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-04 23:39:03,"Well so it's definitely not like the stock market where Bitcoin is just another company 
Bitcoin is like the central value system
And yeah I feel like a lot of people hold Bitcoin in their portfolio at least a little bit? So if that just tanks then it might make people panic and sell their other coins as well 
As more coins establish a usecase beyond speculative investment, this might change because more people will hold the coin in order to use for other things!"

h0nc4i9,,Comment,13,0,2021-06-04 23:31:23,Being able to own a lot of coins is a selling point for shitcoins and scam coins. Bitcoin doesn’t need it.
h0nevum,,Comment,10,0,2021-06-04 23:58:10," Bitcoin’s “unit” already is satoshi. Sometimes, using BTC is more convenient than satoshi. However, I’d agree, especially in regards to the onramps. I’d like to see Kraken, Coinbase, and Gemini have a default for retail trader accounts set to price per satoshi, with a toggle option for Bitcoin (I’d use Bitcoin, personally). 
The unit size bias is real. See yearnFinance and the WOOF token they started offering. yearnFinance went to 96k after offering this 1YFI=1 million WOOF bridge."

h0ncha6,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-04 23:34:39,Seems like more focus on education around fractional ownership and percent gains would make more sense. Trying to change something fundamental like bitcoin's unit at this point is a  heavy handed response to what amounts to lack of experience/knowledge of cryptocurrency for newcomers. I say this as one of those newcomers.
h0nhiat,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-05 00:25:48,"That seems so unnecessarily complicated. The decimal point is largely arbitrary in crypto. Just have it shifted to the left to make more sense and you won't have to have special names for 1 millionth of a coin or whatever.

People are naturally drawn to the best deal thus the toilet paper shortage( big item cheap price) thinking oh my good I have 500k Satoshi is more appealing to the less educated  and new investors. Oh cool I have 0.005 BTC seams like very little. The YT videos selling people on 100X shitcoins is just indulging the dreams of the ""POORS"" we all want to be stable in our lives and not worry about crushing, soul draining debt. But the speculation of BTC getting 3X in the year and 30X in the next 5 years isn't quite as appealing as the 1000X or shit coin to $0.01.
I get the idea it's just marketing and the demographic your marketing too."

h0nck3l,,Comment,-12,0,2021-06-04 23:35:20,"BTC is archaic and will be replaced . The tech of the shit coins you are talking about is exponentially more advanced than BTC.  Keep living in bubble while doge is revamped and SFM keeps giving reflections to those “noobs” that are holding at .00000456.   I love seeing the crypto experts preach while they trashed doge for years .  You sat on a goldmine for years and missed the biggest financial investment of this generation.   All you had to do was put $200 in doge a year ago and maybe I’d listen to you preach about gains . 
Long story short you can relabel BTC all you want but underneath it’s a piece of ancient shit tech and is going to be replaced .

Have put some money into Coinbase over the last few months and am finally moving it off the platform.  I transferred about $200 in batches to trust wallet.  Fees on Coinbase appeared to be a couple of dollars, no big deal.  When I clicked the pending transfer in trust wallet it shows network fees of $37.91.  The transfer has since completed and been twice confirmed.  It lines up with what Coinbase showed me when I started, I only paid a couple of bucks.
My question is what does the $37.91 represent if I only paid about $1.50.  Thanks still doing a lot of learning.
Edit:  whoops Bitcoin not batches."

If you so happened to log into your wallet at the exact same time, well then theoretically you could have a shot at stopping them but you prob wouldn’t know someone else had your seed until they initiated a transfer.
If you then initiated a new wallet with that same phrase... it would be empty
If you lost your wallet but had the phrase and it wasn’t compromised, then you could initiate a new wallet and have access to your crypto again."

I liken it to max security with single point of access, pro is only one ultimate thing to secure, con is there is only a single point of failure loose it and it's gone. Vs something like the bank where all a thief has to do is convince the bank they are ""you"" with stolen info and maby a sim swap or something and the bank gives them access, but a pro is you can't really loose bank money by forgetting a password or something."

h0ol0hv,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-05 09:10:05,"Why do you give so much bad information?
I literally just synced my ledger to a new laptop and all the coins were available to transfer. You don't need the initial computer for anything. All of the relevant information is stored on the hardware wallet. The seed is stored on the hardware wallet. You can use any computer or smartphone and restore those wallets on the new device without ever touching the computer you originally used.
If someone has the hardware wallet plus pin, your coins are gone.
The wallet on your computer only has the public key to let you check how many coins there are on it, just like a blockchainexplorer could."
h0oaaf5,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 07:06:56,"woah that's super info right there! I am also a noob, so you're saying the hardware wallet is somehow linked to your computer with, say for Ledger for example, Ledger Live? And if someone gets their hands on the Nano wallet and your PIN somehow, they still need your computer to do a transfer?"

h0olytt,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 09:19:29,Don't you need to enter the seed phrase to set it up on the new computer? That's what I think Ant112990 meant. That having the hardware key plus PIN does nothing without the seed phrase.

h0ocupr,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 07:39:55,"Your computer is where your wallet is created/restored to (newly generated or restored private key/mnemonic phrase), this device is authorized to make transactions on your wallet. 
Depending on the type of wallet (hot wallet or Cold wallet) you will have a level of security.. Some hot wallets you just click on and send funds without a password, and some with a password. Now cold wallets have more steps before you can make a transaction, you can open the wallet on the computer and look at funds all you want but if try and send funds to another wallet you will need to connect the hardware wallet -> enter 8 digit password on device -> approve transaction. 
I dont use ledger live personally, I use a wallet interface that interacts with my ledger. But ledger live is basically a pretty interface for you to see your coins and add/delete whichever cryptos you plan to store. But ultimately all of the above doesnt matter the most important part is keeping your PRIVATE KEYS/MNEMONIC PHRASE safe!! Dont store it unsecurely on your computer.. And dont tell anybody your phrase/private key.
So in conclusion someone can steal your hardware wallet and password to the wallet but they cant do ANYTHING without your PRIVATE KEY/MNEMONIC PHRASE. You can set up a super secure hardware wallet but if someone gets the private key or mnemonic phrase.. Those funds are gone if the attacker hasnt move them to another wallet you have no control over."
h0omf2z,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-05 09:23:40,"No, because the seed is stored on the hardware wallet. Therefore the hardware wallet will restore with the same seed onto any device you link the hardware wallet with.
If you didn't have the hardware wallet, you would need to enter the seed, however the hardware wallet does that for you. That's why it's critical that no one gets access to it."

h0oxj4g,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 11:02:18,"ETH2 is gonna be a big deal for sure, but I don’t think it’s going to have as much of a financial impact as we are going to see over the changes between now and then, both on and off chain. 
Arbitrum just launched and soon lots of dApps will support it. Having L2 should help keep gas fees lower and scalable. EIP 1559 is still on track for a July afaik. This change in issuance will reduce volume and probably increase price. 
ETH2 and staking will have benefits like stabilising price to a degree as ether gets locked up, but I think the big benefit is the energy utilisation narrative. This is bullish long-term, but I don’t think it will move investors. There are already PoS chains and none of them have taken significant business away from ETH to date. I don’t think this is going to change any time soon, at least based on current trends. 
Just my 2 wei, but personally I’d rather they took a bit longer to deliver 2.0 and make sure it’s done right; I don’t think they’re any worse off for it."

Algo goes straight in the Algo app...perfect!  It just stakes itself (I think) the ALGOs are increasing so seems good to me!
VET goes straight in their app and Voila it appears to stake itself too.
Then I get to ADA and OMG (as in Oh my Goodness!) I now have to pick one and idk which one to choose!  Do I go for a new cute one that hasn't mined a block or do I go for one that appears to have mined a lot of blocks or maybe I should just choose #1 on the list.  There's even a choice of an Elon pool!  Crikey!  I've been looking for nearly 3 hours and I am no where near choosing.
I did think I should print out a list close my eyes and pick one!
So is there a strategy to this?  I just wish they dumped in a pool, so I wouldn't have to choose.
I'm open to ideas.
Thanks!
EDIT:  Thank you for all the replies...they are really helpful.  I've finally narrowed it down to 2 pools...It was just overwhelming seeing so many and not quite understanding how it works.

Treasury fund + transfer fees.
For the time being the staking reward mostly comes out of this fund, but over time that fund will empty and  when Cardano gets more heavily used, the majority of the staking reward will come from transfer fees.
This Treasury fund is essentially there to provide economic incentives for stakers until Cardano gets widely used."

Doing this is incredibly risky especially if you have a family as you could screw your whole family over. Fair enough if you’re single. Crypto is insanely risky over owning property as it’s still so new. People are always going to want to buy property no matter what. I like crypto a lot but saying to put literally your whole future into crypto is pretty crazy.

I also described how price discovery for crypto is different to property. Property price discovery is via auctions normally, which is infrequent. For most crypto (excluding NFTs) the fungible nature of crypto means that exchanges provide prices very quickly. Basically crypto provides more information about price. More information is always better than less information."

h0nkm5d,,Comment,-2,0,2021-06-05 01:00:44,"Why do you think crypto is more risky than property? I personally would feel safer owning BTC than real estate. You can own BTC with a seed phrase. However, when you own property, your name is on a register maintained by the government, and who knows what could happen to this register or your name on it. Furthermore, property is hard to divide. You can buy 0.0005 BTC but not 0.0005 of a house. This limits your ability to diversify or dollar cost average.
Of course, I do agree with you that crypto prices are volatile and more volatile than property. As I mentioned, crypto is expected to 500x in a decade whereas property is expected to 2x. This clearly has more volatility. However, volatility is the reason why you'd invest in property vs holding cash. Crypto is volatile, but property is also very volatile. It can double in ten years or it can halve in ten years. If you wanted no volatility, you wouldn't invest in crypto or property but rather keep your money in USD or whatever your local fiat currency is. The fact that crypto is highly divisible means you can diversify more easily and scale how much volatility you want. For example, just putting 1% of your net worth into bitcoin and the rest in cash would have outperformed the S&P500. You can scale your BTC or crypto exposure to achieve a level of volatility that suits how much risk or volatility you can stomach."

h0nmzo3,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 01:29:29,"Something being tangible doesn't make it safer or better. 
A good example is if you compare property to USD. Property is tangible but USD is not, but property is a more volatile asset compared to USD. 
One reason why I don't like tangible assets is because of the risk of theft. If you own a house or e.g. physical gold, someone could come and destroy your house, steal the title deed, or steal your gold. Properly stored crypto cannot be stolen. Mathematical law in cryptography ensures e.g. bitcoin cannot be stolen. However, the laws of physics enable physical gold or the title deed to property to be stolen."

h0nljxi,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 01:11:54,"This is another reason why I am bullish on crypto. When interest rates go down very low and bank interest rates go down to almost nothing (or negative) then why wouldn't someone go into crypto and earn higher interest via staking or defi? This should increase demand for crypto and increase prices.
I admit this is speculation, but this sort of speculation on supply and demand is no differnet to the speculation required when you buy property e.g. you predict how much demand there will be for the property based on its location, pedestrian traffic, etc."
h0nmig9,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 01:23:29,"I think if you diversify across many crypto, especially the larger cryptos (e.g. BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, etc), it's highly unlikely it will go to zero. Diversifying across the top cryptos is a good strategy, in my opinion.
Property can go to zero. Your ownership of property comes from your name in a government register. The government could collapse or there may be a change of government, with malicious politicians coming in and seizing your property. There are [many example of property disputes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6wY2b9amnA) that resulted in people losing their home.
> houses are backed by insurance
Do you mean flood insurance? Or fire insurance? Either way, these contracts pretty much allow you to take a short position on property. So when there is a flood or a fire, the value of your property goes down, and the insurance company pays you to compensate. Basically, the insurance company pays you if the price goes down. The crypto equivalant is shorting the crypto or simply selling a portion of it. This reduces the degree to which you are long the asset."

You could take $10k - find a stable coin lending scheme with at least 10% APY or equivalent staking mechanism. That will cover the cost of the loan interest repayments regardless of what happens. 
Then I’d put 15 BTC, 15 ETC and then the last 10 on riskier moves. Probably something like 5 on one of the likely runner up coins (ADA/ALGO/XRP) and 5 on moonshots (not meme bullshit - but just small cap speculation)"

Maybe watch for another month. We have been sideways for 2 weeks now. Bitcoin peak price was nearly 8 weeks ago. Surely we will either have a go at a dead cat bounce (which could be the beginning of a recovery) or crash more spectacularly in the next 2 weeks or so.
If it crashes and you invest now, prepare to see you investment shrink by half or possibly much more. Last time round ada dived to less than 2% of its peak price during winter- a drop of more than 50 fold- $100k invested at the wrong moment became worth $2k!

With that being said, Bitcoin is the greatest appreciating asset of all time, according to the data. It is fully decentralized. There isn't a CEO of bitcoin or someone pulling the strings. Personally, I think that is the safest and least riskiest crypto to put money into.
I think ethereum is good to put money into and then after the EIP-1559 update, after that initial supposedly deflationary pump we'll see, it may be wise to pull that money out of ethereum and see where the market is headed. 
I like Cardano. I am concerned about Charles Hoskinson and some of the rumors about him, but so far, I see good things for it. 
I think a coin like XRP and/or Stellar are decent to invest into since they are the coins banks and governments are investing into.
Theta may be worth looking into. 
These are the ones I like. I would like to research Solana as well but I don't know enough about it. For that matter, I am not an expert or financial advisor on any of these coins and neither is anyone else on here. 
You absolutely need to do your own research if you're throwing that kind of money around. Research the people behind these projects. Research their backgrounds and their goals. Research the institutions backing them and read about the cons they have. Research the technology and what niche they are going to fullfill. All of these Cryptos have pros and cons. I think crypto is the future like you but it is also like the dot com bubble in many ways and many coins will not survive in my opinion."

h0o96mh,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-05 06:51:50,"Investing with borrowed money is risky and most certainly not what you should always do. Would you take a million dollars loan at 2%? Ten million? If the answer is no then obviously on some level you realize that it's not free money and a relatively low interest rate isn't the only factor in play. 
There is no such thing as free money. Inflation isn't going to magically let you pay the loan back if you gamble it away. Crypto is not a sure bet. If there were a guaranteed way to do better than 2% the bank would most certainly be doing that instead of giving you the money.
Yes you could make some extra profit with this maneuver, but you are opening yourself up to being upside down on your mortgage if the housing market tanks. If you lose your job and can't afford the extra payment you could lose your house. The downsides are huge if this goes wrong. Even if nothing that extreme happens, there is a very significant chance you end up paying hundreds of dollars a month for decades to repay the money you lost. Your loan won't be interest-only forever."

We have revisited prices from early feb and Jan. Btc peak is actually pretty far behind us now. The hype phase was well and truly entered into- all (I guess except for you) of the newbies coming in and bringing fresh money into crypto to continue the run already came in over the last 2 months and got burned. Or if they didn’t and were thinking about it they are glad they didn’t. A price revisit event of 4 months duration can happen early in the run pre parabolic phase when no one really knows what’s happening. Or if it happens later it’s the end of the run it’s the end of it- unless a double spoke or something- but no indication of that. For the run to continue Btc has to go above $65k again, otherwise it’s just slowly down. Any significant moves toward that would result in a lot of second chance “what a relief I get to sell at price x$” selling imo, limiting any upward move too much. But who knows?

All in exchange for a tiny interest during these years that you return it (and inflation works for you because each originally borrowed dollar is worth less and less each year that passes). 
I don't understand how this is not discussed more. If you start up a business to make money you get a loan. You can do the same with investing/trading. Just don't be an idiot to lose it (that can happen)."

If you do, make sure you put it into coins that earn APR. With ALGO (if using the official wallet which I suggest) remember that to earn compound interest you have to do a small transaction to yourself every once in a while otherwise your rewards don't count towards further rewards. 
I seriously wish you the best and I hope it all works out for you. I'd love to be wrong about this. Good luck out there dude!"

h0nup67,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-05 03:14:29,"Not sure about similar to March last year- differences: that was still crypto winter or just the beginning of coming out of it- which wasn’t clear until after the fact. There was minimal main stream media coverage of Btc. No mainstream media coverage of alts. Minimal interest from people who weren’t already holders. No parabolic phase yet. oh and a rapidly evolving pandemic with loads of associated uncertainty.
12 months later we have had a parabolic phase. We have had wide spread hype and newbie buy in. The pandemic is running a clearer course. The newbie buy in and hype across mainstream media is the main thing that is different IMO. 12 months ago all those newbies were yet to come, now they are in and burned or scared off"

It’s absolutely crazy that I will have made close to $200,000 profit on this investment and I KNOW the electric vehicle run up that’s about to happen will grow faster than real estate. Not to mention crypto. 
Long term I totally agree with you; I want to retire with like 5 rental houses and that’s it, passive income into the sunset- but this one deal is going to set me up with a $200k start in what will be a stock market as big as the start of the internet."

If 400$ a month seems a lot to you it's fine, each at his own pace. But this is not uber rich, far from it. 
Making profits takes financing. If you don't finance yourself you'll take much longer and be wealthy when you're 60. Mortgages are the cheapest and easiest way to secure finance for the individual. 
Loans are not inherently bad. When you realise this, youll unlock the way towards wealth. Otherwise you're just crawling towards it. 
But one must be careful. As you say: there are risks."

h0nvnk7,,Comment,10,0,2021-06-05 03:28:52,"The U.S. Gov is trying to figure out what do do about crypto. At $200 billion market cap, crypto was a silly side show. That was just over a year ago. Now it’s a $2 trillion market. Regulation of crypto as a security would, I think, be cripple many coins. Ripple could still be a corporation. Ripple could still sell its product to banks—but buyers would probably buy Ripple stock instead of XRP. There’s more speculation in crypto right now. 
Frankly, the U.S. Gov just doesn’t gain anything from validating currencies to compete with the dollar. Per the Constitution, only Congress can decided what is and is not a currency. 
There’s a lot of U.S. movement on the regulatory side. 
—the House Financial Services Committee recently met with bank regulators. During this meeting bank regulators added an anti-climate change agenda to their policy goals. This could be seen as an empowering themselves to regulate PoW coins. 
—the National Intelligence Council recently declared digital currencies a threat to the dollar 
—Yellen (Treasury) wants $10k transactions to be reported, which will allow the government to target decentralized exchanges that don’t have this info (primary space for shit coins)
—Maxine Walters, head of House Financial Services Committee, asked Zuck to have Facebook wait to release its crypto until a regulator structure is in place. Zuck ignored this require. Walters has stated that crypto is a threat to the dollar. 
—Gensler (SEC) believes all ICO coins should be regulated as securities. The Howey Test is ruling precedent + there are constitutional considerations given that Congress has final decision power on currency. A key part of the Howey Test is whether investors in an asset depend on the actions of a third-party’s “active participants” (like Ripple, Inc) to drive the price. Ripple has a CEO. Nine office locations. 500 employees. The SEC chose Ripple because it’s an easy win. I think Ripple knows it has a weak case and is this focusing on public pressure and hiring lobbyists, because ultimately crypto regs will be a Congressional decision—regardless of what the court decides. 
—the Office of Comptroller is considering a repeal of the rule to allow institutions to be custodians of crypto for clients. 
There’s a major circling of the wagons to attack crypto. I also think the Colonial Pipeline attack was a major wake-up call. Untraceable digital money…we have barely scratched the surface on potential crypto crimes."

Honestly the first generation to join into crypto understood this. Now that it's more of an investment for most users they want the benefits of gains that crypto can bring but none of the risk.
The way these are designed as well, it's not going to be possible to regulate these things so easily. The government can't take over bitcoin as an example because it's decentralized and it can be forked and then what?

The Brooklyn Bridge — “If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell to you”
￼
Ever since I was a young person, I have used the phrase, “If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell to you”.  The phrase originated because for over a century people have fallen for the con that New York City is selling the Brooklyn Bridge.
George C. Parker (1860-1936), a native New Yorker, was responsible for originating the phrase.  Parker, of whose life we know became famous for selling New York City landmarks of all kinds ranging from Madison Square Garden to the Statue of Liberty.  He also sold the Metropolitan Museum of Art and even Grant’s tomb as the general’s grandson!
He would set up fake sales offices and forge documents to support his cons. One of his most popular places for spotting rubes or victims was Ellis Island where some of the immigrants came with money to invest in new enterprises.   Out-time out-of-town tourists on their first visit to New York comprised another favorite target.
His greatest con was selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  Legend claimed that he sold it at least twice a week.  He did sell it several times including at least once for $50,000!  The new owner would be discovered he was the victim of a con when the New York police officers would stop the “new owners” from setting up toll booths in the middle of the bridge.

Earlier this year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered local banking institutions to identify and shut down any accounts tied to crypto platforms.

The reason crypto has a huge future in Africa is for the same reasons that the country has cell towers everywhere instead of huge lengths of copper line.  
It's about bootstrap infrastructure being able to jump over prerequisites that the developed countries had to build sequentially.  
Think about that, the ubiquitous tool is the cell phone.  Not physical banks, not continental wide infrastructure, not well connected industrial sector supply chains. The bulk of the continent is effectively decentralized simply due to geography, and a fractured network of tribalistic factions. 
In a situation like that, anyone tapped into the economy at all has a phone as the barrier to entry.  Anyone achieving that who wants to do anything is going to use that to access non-local markets. 
Crypto will serve as a unifying factor in emerging distribution chains.  Those who are tied into it have a future, have access to capital, can exchange across borders, all of it.  Those that don't are still waiting to get wired in."

nsldgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nsldgq/pay_attention_to_apr_vs_apy/,Pay attention to APR vs APY,509,129,2021-06-04 22:15:18,"Many exchanges offer interest rates on your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when you deposit with them.  When shopping for the best interest rates, pay attention to whether the rate is APR or APY.  The difference is subtle, but important, especially for large amounts.
APR, or Annual Percentage RATE, gives you the rate at which your original deposit accrues interest.  If you allow it to compound, rolling the interest into the original amount, the APR number does not take that interest into account - so you're also earning interest on your interest.
APY, or Annual Percentage YIELD, gives you the amount at which your deposit will pay out after one year.  It takes the interest that you're earning into account on that payout.  You're not earning any additional interest on the interest, because it's already been factored into the APY number.
This site has a handy calculator to help you see the difference: https://www.aprtoapy.com/
Edit: A quick edit for something u/MegaUltraHorndog pointed out:
Pay attention to where your interest on the deposit goes.  
APY interest *must* be rolled back into the original deposit in order to work, and the money can't be touched for an entire year in order to get that APY number.  If you withdraw any of it early, you're not getting the APY percentage.
APR interest is often deposited in a different part of the account, so you have to manually roll it back in yourself if you want to earn interest on it.  The good part is, you're still earning the same *rate*, even if you withdraw the interest, or take your money out early.
I hope that clears that up."

What I think that happens is that you are comparing yields from different type of ""stacking"". If you lock them, you are receiving from what you locked.

Crypto.com has decent rates for many coins, but you have to stake a lot of CRO to get access to the best rates.
Nexo has some good rates, but you have to hold a percentage in their own coin to qualify.
Coinbase pays 6% APY on ALGO (which is what led me to research the difference on APY vs APR), and 6% APR on ETH ( but you have to stake until ETH2 is released, which could be anytime between next year and the day after the Apocalypse).
Shop around and keep your eyes open on this sub, and you'll find one that works for you.  Just remember to read the fine print."

h0ozfop,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-05 11:18:37,"The trick with APY is that it gives you exactly what it states - an *Annual* Percentage Yield.

Where are you finding a 40% APY??"
h0oswjk,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-05 10:23:10,"APY technically does earn interest on the interest, but that interest is already factored into the number you get.  So over a year's time, a 10% APY will give you the same returns as a 10% APR, *if* you withdraw your APR interest instead of letting it compound.  If you *don't* withdraw your APR interest, over that same year a 10% APR will give you *better* returns than a 10% APY."

So over a year's time, a 10% APY will give you the same returns as a 10% APR, *if* you withdraw your APR interest instead of letting it compound.  
If you *don't* withdraw your APR interest, over that same year a 10% APR will give you *better* returns than a 10% APY.
The trick is seeing where your interest goes after it's earned.  APY has to be kept with the interest bearing deposit in order to work.  APR is often deposited in a different  part of the account, so you have to put it back in with the interest bearing deposit yourself."

If you let your ALGO sit for an entire year, at the end of that you'll have 6% more.  The APY number has already factored in the compounding interest. 
If you were getting 6% APR, at the end of the year you'd have *more* than 6%, *if* you reinvest the interest and let it compound.  If you withdraw the interest, then at the end of the year you'll end up with the same 6% extra that the APY gives you."

And question 2, am I able to set limit orders on active trader and have it use money I have in Gemini earn? For example, could I set a buy order for BTC at $30k for $1,000 and have it fill using GUSD that I have stored on Gemini earn? TIA for any answers"

Why am I using these two coins to draw the comparison? Well besides having a similar amount of coins. They were also both released in 2015, just 3 months apart. I think alot of people write off NANO like it is some new coin trying to ride this years trend.
I think it's one of the few opportunities left in this space with such an massive asymmetrical upside to it."

h0efhvs,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-03 00:06:09,"Sounds like a lot of coins, given Bitcoin only mints 96,162 Bitcoins per year. But did you know Bitcoin minted 96,162,000,000,000 Satoshis in 2020?
Changing the base unit can make a dramatic shift in how large the inflation seems to be. However, it only makes sense to consider the percentage inflation per year. The raw units do not allow any basis for comparison between coins, because every crypto denominates their coins differently. And in percentage terms Doge's inflation isn't high - it's 3.94% this year, and it falls every year from here on."

It's not clear that it is good for Bitcoin that its inflation goes to literally 0% in the very long run, nor is it clear that this is a meaningful difference from Dogecoin (which goes to 0.0000000000000000000001% inflation in the very long run, but never to literally 0%)."

2016 was the 8th year of Bitcoin’s life, and Bitcoin had 6.95% supply increase during 2016.
As for ""infinite"", there is no meaningful difference between a coin that in the very long run reduces its supply to literally 0%, and a coin that reduces is it to an arbitrarily small percent (0.00000000000001%) but not literally 0%. If anything is a mistake to turn off supply completely because nobody can predict what this will do the security of the network."

nr4a84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nr4a84/ripple_seeks_docs_from_15_offshore_exchanges_it/,Ripple seeks docs from 15 offshore exchanges it says could be ‘fatal’ to the SEC’s charges,12,13,2021-06-02 23:56:01,"Ripple believes records held by offshore exchanges will prove its executives did not violate Section 5 of the Securities Act by offloading XRP on the U.S. public.
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, have filed a motion requesting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigate Bitfinex’s parent company, iFinex, and 14 other international crypto exchanges.
The June 2 motion requests documents from exchanges including iFinex, Bitforex, Bithumb, Bitlish, BitMart, AscendEX (formerly Bitmax), Bitrue Singapore, Bitstamp, Coinbene, HitBTC, Huobi Global, Korbit, OKEx, Upbit Singapore, and ZB Network Technology
The motion’s supporting memorandum notes the letters of request solicit assistance from authorities in the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Seychelles, and Malta.
The SEC’s amended complaint against Ripple accuses Garlinghouse and Larsen of selling more than two billion units of XRP to “public investors” located “all over the world,” with the SEC seeking disgorgement from Ripple’s executives based on the sales.
Ripple’s executives deny the SEC’s allegations they violated Section 5 of the 1933 Securities Act, emphasizing that Section 5 specifically prohibits the domestic sale of securities without a registration statement. Garlinghouse and Larsen’s legal representation counter that their XRP sales were conducted on foreign exchanges and thus outside of the SEC’s jurisdiction:
“In the case of transactions conducted on such foreign trading platforms, both the offers of XRP and the sales of XRP occurred on the books and records of the respective platforms, and therefore geographically outside the United States. The SEC’s failure to allege domestic offers and sales should be fatal to its claims.”
Ripple asserts the exchanges and related entities subject to its new motion “possess unique documents and information” regarding Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, specifically concerning “the process by which transactions in XRP allegedly conducted by the Individual Defendants on foreign digital asset trading platforms were conducted.”
The SEC amended its complaint against Ripple and the firm’s executives in February, alleging their sales of XRP suppressed the crypto asset’s price. The complaint also accuses Garlinghouse and Larsen of misleading public investors while offloading billions of dollars worth of XRP as Garlinghouse repeatedly claimed he was “very long” on XRP during the time of the alleged sales.
The filing comes just days after a significant blow was dealt to the SEC’s case against Fipple, with the court rejecting the SEC’s bid to access communications between Ripple and its legal counsel."

Joke aside, I guess it isn't good that reddit show how many to have, and since your number is quite big you will get those messages from time to time.
Maybe they should implement a way to hide the total moons for the whales.
We, the poor 1 moon people don't suffer from that kind of problems :)"

h0ee35i,,Comment,12,0,2021-06-02 23:52:40,"I got in initially for the apy. However, once I transfered my coins to the official wallet, saw that it took only 4 seconds and cost me .001 ALGO I was hooked. The team is amazing.
Only downsides I have seen so far is...
1.) There is accelerated vesting. This means if algo starts to go high too fast more coins are released into the supply to limit the upwards speed. The vesting was supposed to go until 2030 however we are a couple years ahead of schedule now. I don't personally find this bad as I hold it for the long term and it makes the coin less swingy imo.
2.) Still pretty centralized. However governance is coming in October and this should be sorted out in time.
Overall I'm extremely bullish on it because of the the team and tech. There has been a lot of bullish news recently.
For the record my portfolio is 30% eth, 30% algo, 20% btc, 10% ada and 10% xlm"
h0edr6b,,Comment,7,0,2021-06-02 23:49:33,its been around for a while but the creators apparently were too busy with developing to be bothered with marketing or messaging. i think youre hearing about it all of a sudden because charles hoskinson is on public record saying algo team is doing impressive work and the creator is one of the smartest and best minds in the field. hoskinson notoriously does NOT praise easily so...
h0ed9nn,,Comment,4,0,2021-06-02 23:44:57,Only con is that it isn't under a dollar.
h0ee2o3,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-02 23:52:32,"I think most of its cons come from a) marketing and b) catering to corporations. It's not really a truly decentralized currency, it's more built to give enterprises control over private nlockchains or apps they build on the platform. Whether you're okay with this or not is up to you, but it hurts their image i a lot of people's eyes. 
The marketing's just bad (I don't mind, would rather resources goto development.) 
There's also the fairly large amount of Algo retained by the Algorand Foundation."
h0eeh3u,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-02 23:56:25,"It's good to question stuff. Algorand is the real deal, though.   If you research you'll see.
This was today, with the mayor of Miami:
https://youtu.be/XrPr1iEl_Fw"
h0efrqe,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 00:08:45,"About the only con people bring up is that it's not very decentralized *yet*.  The project is still very new so the tokens are still being distributed.  It will become more and more decentralized over time.  More participation nodes will be added over time as well.   Currently there are over 1200.  
Another complaint is that it's not marketed much.  This is true but it's mostly because they're marketing to corporate and government mainly and forming major partnerships as a result.  Just look at their current partnerships listed on their site then look at all the new partnerships, including the city of Miami and SAP corporation, over the past 10 days alone.  
The tech is top notch and the team is one of the best in the business.  It's headed by Silvio Macali who is one of the greatest minds in the cryptography field.  
The technicals are incredible as well.  It can handle 46,000 tps and finalizes in under 5 seconds.  Those are actual real world stats, not projected numbers in a lab.  
Highly recommend that you take the time to do your own research.  The documentation is excellent for this project."

They have some pretty impressive partnerships especially related to their commitment to sustainability.

Disadvantage if you are looking at it as an investment is probably the tokenomics. They release coins to steady the price up until a time where they are all released. This might actually help it long term but definitely puts the brakes on short term.

h0ed1a1,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-02 23:42:43,Exactly the same as every other scam coin out there. I’d be careful if I were you.
nr3x16,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nr3x16/about_nfts/,About NFT’s…,1,20,2021-06-02 23:34:40,"Are there currently any mechanisms in place to prevent someone from selling someone else’s artwork as an NFT and claiming the profits? 
For example there are a lot of digital small unknown digital artists on reddit, what would prevent someone from saving their image and uploading it to an NFT platform like open sea of makersplace and posing as the creator? 
I couldn’t find any articles or websites that would have such a protocol in place to circumvent this from occurring. Is this act rarely done solely based on moral values?"
h0ecbdt,,Comment,7,0,2021-06-02 23:35:52,oh crap. thanks for the idea!
h0eczuo,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-02 23:42:20,"I imagine if the original creator finds you and has the means, it likely won't end well for the impersonator.  Copyright?  Idk"
h0ed28u,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-02 23:42:59,I would imagine the IP laws in place either where the the artist is or person who sells it is would protect the artist. (Sorry this is poorly worded but you get the gist).
h0ejuqp,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 00:49:02,"The only 'mechanism' in place is the marketplaces as far as I understand, i've seen community NFT creators sort out complaints with marketplaces around dupes before so that's the 'regulator' in this capacity"
h0edcvj,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-02 23:45:47,Copyright infringement is copyright infringement regardless of whether or not you sell it before you get caught. Nothing would prevent someone from selling someone else’s work. You just follow them with a lawsuit.
h0eic5e,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-03 00:34:15,Someone was on here trying to sell NFTs that were literally screenshots from a music video. People will try anything to make a buck.
h0eii0s,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-03 00:35:52,"Part of the nft is who issued it. So the nft issuer needs to be trusted they verified. 
So yes someone could, but it would be seen as produced by someone else."

h0eh0kt,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 00:21:05,"It's just Apple store BS.  Probably just a bug, but even if it's crazy uncle Apple being serious and trying to restrict vaults, you still have them outside the Apple ecosystem, even though the iPeople forget there's tons of us perfectly happy without iStuff.
They'll come back. Moons are a security, and Apple likely can't actually screw with your vault, though Reddit could theoretically stop supporting it."

We can find people in the “hive” easier and communicate in mere SECONDS. Everybody has individual communication. Nobody can see what people are saying. Actually except for Facebook/ The NSA/ and any 3rd party really. They see whats overall happening in the “Hive” and twist it to their agendas. 
Now with blockchain we are each our own individuals but together in this blockchain system we can transfer “value”, execute neutral “3rd party” transfers, create applications and much more. In a hive like society.
Vsauce mentions towards the last part of the video at 26:12 about a lottocracy. 
https://youtu.be/_ArVh3Cj9rw
A lottocracy is a form of government where its decisions are made by people chosen at random. Think of jury duty and its attempt to choose random jurors to decide someones fate. If people are chosen at random, corruptors would have to basically corrupt everyone? So everyone wins.
I am not saying a whole society will run on this but I believe we are headed in that direction within civilizations. 
Which i then notice 1 key blockchain that fits what a lottocratic society would look like. Algorand. Its name is short for Algorithmic  Randomness. A key feature in its system.
Does this make any sense? Am i crazy?"

Think about Cardano another way.  Put aside this idea that it has to become the king of first world blockchains. That's Ethereum's domain and whether or not it gets its fees in order is anyone's guess, and it doesn't matter.  The first world is happy to build on Ethereum even if it costs $200 a transaction.
Regardless of whatever you think about the technology, Cardano is positioned, geographically and politically, to capture a billion users. You probably watched that last video waiting to see some sizzle that you come to expect from these reddit threads: what's the TPS, what's the hot dapp, where's the defi, and so on. That kind of innovation is not happening at Cardano, despite the claims that hydra can scale at 1 trillion TPS or whatever nonsense.  So can Lightning if everyone just kindly became an ISP and devoted their lives to babysitting validators.
Now try looking at the forest through the trees: look at the global sophistication at play, the collaboration that's starting to spread like fire through those communities.
You get a billion people on the platform, is it scalable, and then the mom and pops and the industries want to build on top of it and sell them pizza and banking and facebook and gamer girl bath water. 
 Cardano is so ahead of every large cap on the strategy of making itself the low-cost work horse of web 3.0 in all these secondary markets, and one day, wow, a billion active wallets. 
That's the one thing."

What is Cardano's geographical and political position to capture a billion use? Cardano's tech are not the most cutting edge and I don't think it needs to be. But if you are saying a billion user just because of its collaboration efforts mainly in Africa, you are truly being bullish without any data to back you up.
If you are saying there is no innovation and you are simply being bullish on this ""global sophistication"" and ""collaboration that spread like fire"", you are telling me that it is the future? You're lucky that Cardano has the Ouroboros and IOHK behind it, posting ""peer-reviewed"" articles that might going to give you some insights on how cryptocurrency (or at least cryptography) works.
I can't understand the last three paragraphs that you are rambling about. That's not ""one thing"", that is more than one thing. The common theme would hype. And that's it.
Cardano by any means are feasible to build on and be used, but it is not the lord and savior that you purport it to be. I'd be fine if they are at lower price... but as it stands today, it is overvalued for what it is. Or rather, there are no other objectively hyping collaboration other than the Africa collaboration. Even then, I have yet to see its deployment on Africa and its tendency to not fulfill the arbitrary roadmap for development.
What is undeniable is, however, its already existing market cap. It is big. Let's just hope the hype does not repeat the fall of Substratum that had been frequently reported by the older members in this sub."

Most clients I dealt with have never had a bank account because it’s just too complicated and untrustworthy. I’m talking about the subsided housing recipients, free and reduced school  lunch households and cash assistance poor. The American culture of poverty has no trust in bank accounts. ADA could be a huge game changer for Generational impoverished Americans taking ownership in their pay checks, and incentivize them to trust in conventional financial practices such as investing in the future."

Just like in China you can pay for things and load cash at many 7-11 type stores and what can happen is that phone payments for items and services often become more common than cash. You see you're imagining that people are on payrolls and get an amount in their bank every month, but that's not how things work. Someone might pay you for a ride in your car or for helping them move stuff or whatever by transferring $ directly and you can then use the same app to pay for things at the store. Its a mistake to think that people in developing countries are 'poor', their small businesses usually do just fine - what's missing is the ability to take that success any further - with no trustworthy financial infrastructure they can't borrow to expand operations, with no stability to their currency there is no point to saving etc.

h0eboz2,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-02 23:29:58,"You can look at their current project in Ethiopia as one example: bringing digital identity to 5M school age children so that they can prove their education to an institution of higher learning potentially halfway around the world if necessary, or even just to a local potential employer one day. It's about basic and necessary infrastructure that the developed world takes for granted: being able to prove who you are, what you know, your medical records, your creditworthiness, what you own, etc., because it is all recorded on a digital ledger which can't be tampered with or destroyed by anyone.
Digital identity brings with it the ability to obtain and offer peer-to-peer loans. It also brings the ability to receive remittances without having to pay exhorbitant international transfer fees. The list goes on and on.
Let's say you have an idea for a business or a small business you'd like to grow into a larger one in Ghana, but you need funding. Within Cardano, there will be the ability for someone in Seattle to offer you a loan to fund that business. Maybe a group of someones from Europe, Asia and North America each chip in a little bit to fund that loan. You don't need to go hat in hand to a bank: you can get that loan directly from other people and your loan repayments can be dispersed back to each investor with a single click of the button.
Cardano is about so much more than just using it to buy goods and services: it's ultimately about affording people the chance to participate on an equal footing whether you live in Nigeria or Iceland by creating the infrastructure necessary to afford those who don't have today the privilege of taking the basics for granted."

I honestly believe this AMC/GME business that's going on in the stock market at the moment was a huge catalyst behind selloffs over the past 2 weeks as Hedge Funds try and cover their arses.  
Now that AMC is getting traction, its attracting retail investments into the stock, rather than into Bitcoin.
Im happy to be proved wrong over the coming day, but i think this current downspike will continue further south and set a lower low."

nr2v7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nr2v7w/be_careful_with_telegram_scams/,Be careful with telegram scams…,6,18,2021-06-02 22:34:52,"Recently was added to this chat group Bitbank Chat, with 3000plus members and numerous chats log. 
They were running this giveaway where you transfer minimum 0.5 BTC/1 ETH/1000 XRP and within 4-8mins you will get double back. I know this sounds like a scam immediately. But what caught my attention is the number of members who claim they received the reward, post screenshot and thank the admin group. I knew this was a scam and I went to look closer.
Red flags:
1) You have to give them crypto first before you receive your reward
2) The “happy” recipients always have a standard thank you message template (how they are grateful, they doubt initially but thankful afterwards)
3) Profile pic of members doesn’t match the language used. I see an Arab guy in the profile pic speaking Chinese & Two Brazilians looking guy with a female Chinese name. 
4) Weird telegram names
Before greed takes over you, points to consider:
1) There are no free things in this world. If they want to give free crypto, they wouldn’t ask for your crypto in advance before giving theirs. Ask yourself why can’t it be another way round where they give you your reward first then you give them yours
2) Cryptocurrency, although digital, is also money. Would you take a stack of note to give someone in hope someone give you double the stack back? 
3) They don’t invite you into the chat because you’re special and they want to do give you such opportunity. There are 7 billions people on this Earth. You ain’t special. Get hold of yourself.
4) if it sounds too good to be true, remember one word: BIIIITTTCONNNECTTT
TLDR: Beware of telegram chat group scam offering free double crypto when you send them yours first"

You are investing for you. Please don't spend more than you can afford to lose because you feel your investment isn't large enough. I know how it feels to own 1/2 of a coin, visit that coin's subreddit and see people talking about how they just picked up 25 more coins (even though it took me 3 months of DCAing to get half a coin). I quickly realized I invested in something I believe in, and my investment size is right for me.  I did at first feel the urge to put more money in so I don't miss out on huge gains, but I need my other fiat and I am NOT okay with losing it. So I didn't gamble. 
I think there are a lot of new investors who can safely afford to lose only small amounts of fiat. I bet there are a lot more than you think. They just don't post about how they picked up $8 more of a coin. 
Friends, make the investment that is right for you and don't worry about how much other people can afford to invest."

But I managed to put in enough to build up a great nest egg in the future so I don't let it get to me.  And if I just put 20 bucks in, I still wouldn't let it get to me because the real payoff here is the fact that now and in the future, most people if not everyone will be able to grow their money, which most people have never been able to do.  I remember hearing stories from my dad about how easy it was to get a decent-paying job and grow your income through investments and CDs.  
I grew into adulthood feeling extremely vulnerable.  I make enough to get by and all, but I know my income is diminishing in value and the whole traditional financial system is on thin ice, so I know that even though everything feels safe, it's totally not and it's absolutely possible that at some point, I could lose everything.  The only hope that I see for me is my investments in crypto, which is crazy, but also not when you consider the fact that I really have nothing to lose.  
My hope is that one day, I'll never have to cash out of crypto and instead live off of the gains.  But again, even if I didn't invest enough, that's okay because with crypto you it seems like they'll always be opportunities to grow your money, something that's completely foreign to my generation."

And even then I kept thinking that if I just put more the number would be better. But I realized that if I dca properly I can continue to pay my responsibilities and end up with a bit over 2k in the market over the year. That's decent enough and ideally will help me get through nursing school or even pay off my bills and credit cards. I mean if I become financially free then I can play with a little more next time.

Ride this bull market, make as much bank.  Get out before it overheats, don't worry about trying to time it just right ...get out while the damn exchanges are still up and you are in profit or go to a DEX and swallow the gas fees to swap to a stable coin like USDC.

I will add you need to know which max % of your savings you can put in the investment.
It's totally different a reasonable a large % of savings to invest from a young person with growing monthly income perspective than and old retired person with less monthly income and relying on his savings. The first one could be go to 50% or 60% of his savings and what he believe is the best investment of his live. The second should not go beyond 25%

It might have to be the $5 guy and I picking up the next “ADA at 2¢” and holding for a year, and the $1000 guy buying BTC at 64k and panic selling at 33k last week, but extremely smart and/or lucky small investments are totally capable of outdoing extremely dumb and/or unlucky large ones, and not just as a fluke.

h0f0f47,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 04:25:16,"Great post. There is so much FOMO because of posts pumping projects. Then when things don’t work out, this sub is full of suicide prevention advice. Your advice is sound, don’t risk more than you can afford."

>I think there are a lot of new investors who can safely afford to lose only small amounts of fiat. I bet there are a lot more than you think. They just don't post about how they picked up $8 more of a coin. 
How the fuck did you get access to my wallet"
h0f0nhg,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 04:28:50,"I like the spirit of this. It feels really good to know that the amount you have in crypto is an amount you’re willing to lose. I can’t imagine the ulcers of those who “bet” money did they actually need — now or soon.
I might add:
Get your money into the exchanges with Coinbase Pro, not regular Coinbase, or those $3 fees will kill your ability to invest small/reasonable size amounts. 
When I transfer money from my bank to Coinbase Pro, and then use that to buy crypto, it keeps the fees down to something like a penny or less, and I can comfortably do little $10 and $15 purchases if I want."
h0f115a,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 04:34:44,I have less than 100usd in and it's an absolute blast to learn about the cryptos and investing in general. Changed the whole way I viewed investing as someone who'd never got into it prior. I also have a small side balance I just use to day trade and see if I can earn a little extra for fun. Plus the community here is really great and funny so I decided to stick around
h0f18v5,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-03 04:37:57,"Thanks. I feel like such a noob sometimes. I haven always wanted to play around with investing and started this March. But I'm a dad and most of my money goes to the kids and the house. I don't want to invest anything I can't spare. And I still want to have money on my savings account. What I did was the following. 
Talked to my wife about a new hobby and said I will spend 30 euros a month on it.
* I opened an account to buy and sell stocks. Bought 3 AMC stock for 10 dollar
* Waited a month, send 30 more euros to my stock account. Bought 1 additional AMC for 12 dollar and spend the rest on something long term
* Learned about crypto in the meanwhile and opened a crypto account. Send 30 euros to my crypto in May, and again 2 days ago in June.
* Sold 3 amc's for 50 dollar each and kept 1 just to see how far it goes.
* Send the 150 dollar to my crypto
So, it's just play money, but currently my 120 euros is worth around 310 euros, which is a much bigger return than I anticipated. Again, it's just playing with a little bit of cash for fun. I am still reading up on all the crypto, their proposition, the amount circulating and the activity from the community and developer and it's history and so far it's just a fun hobby. I have some Ada, Eth, Vet, etc, btc, link, xvg and vtho (which i get from staking).
I read up on several subreddits and discords and I see numbers flying around that people are investing. Makes me feel like such an idiot. But yeah, I just don't want to spend big bucks. I need to be able to pull money from my savingsaccounts when stuff goes down, like the car breaks down, or the dish washer needs replacement, or the roof needs fixing you know."

I celebrated heartily when it made me a thousandaire. Since then I've researched and invested in a few other cryptos, just a hundred or two at a time. No major risks for me. Even in this dip, I am up about 2X overall, which is an enormous profit over the span of a couple years. 
Every time I look at the account, I ask myself if I'm comfortable losing all of it. If it got up near $10k, I'd probably say no and would take out some profit. Screw this ""diamond hands"" concept. Unless it's a super stable investment, I am not comfortable putting that much money on the table."

There will be people that might make the same dollar value gains on a much bigger principal with lower returns; who’s the better investor? It’s important to remember it’s not a pissing contest, it’s a chance for all of us to grow our wealth. 
Having said all that, keep in mind that the best possible crypto scenario is growing your principal investment while also benefiting from gain in coin price. If you are comfortable with a platform that supports staking (like ADA, ALGO, soon-to-be-ETH) you can earn compounding interest *in addition to* speculating on future price. This is almost like buying a promising bit of real estate that also happens to grow in size by 3-6% every year. Even if you’re a Bitcoin maxi there are services that will pay you interest on your BTC that you can reinvest. DYOR of course, but there are so many ways to be smart with crypto it’s amazing."

You have to start doing one to begin doing the other but timing is fucking everything.. I didn't begin my DCAing during the last segment of a bull run, instead I begun during the tail end of a bear run which is actually far easier to do than you might think if you're patient. At this point if you're buying you need to know where the last target is before the bear market so you can get out before the whipsaw. I am still buying but I know nearly exactly where the crypto market is going, do you?"

I’ve been putting every penny I can live without at the end of each week into Cardano since March to try to avoid something similar happening and have around 2000 ADA now and I’m more proud of that than just about anything else in my financial portfolio (I do like my 1000 Algo as well, that 6% will be cool if they’re ever worth something). 
Small investments add up to big investments.
My initial goal was to pay off a $1500 personal loan for as little as possible by making the minimum payments and putting what I would have paid on it into Cardano; I paid it off in a month for about $600 of my own money invested (in addition to putting $300 of the loan itself into Cardano). This has become my new favorite strategy, though it obviously won’t always work. It’s also allowed me to stack up an amount of crypto/ coins I wouldn’t have imagined having before. I uhh, don’t necessarily recommend it though, I could have paid off that loan for $3000 invested if things had swung the other way.
I make about $1500 a month and have a few side hussles that I put all the income from into crypto when I can."

One thing I like to do is go to the [rich list](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) to get a better picture of where I actually stand. If everyone around you (Reddit) is talking about huge sums, your .01 BTC might seem like nothing. However, if you look at the wallet scanner, you'll see that you're in the top 25%! How you perceive yourself is all relative to those around you. Who knows? You may be someone's ""man, I wish I had THAT much XYZ"".
Further, we need to remember how early this all is. If (hopefully when) crypto really takes off and gets mass adopted, we're in the first couple percent of early adopters. The above example may be disappointing to ""only"" be in the top quarter (already an accomplishment!), but think about where you'll be when there's 10x the people using it and you have been stacking sats for years!"

But do we really need to know about it? I'm not sure if this is hypocrisy or if you really do not realize how dumb you look when you post about your $5 investment on a shitcoin?
Be like the silent majority, and keep it to yourself.
Also one thing to think about, to not completely shit on your post: if your investment ever grows in a significant percentage (let's say +1000%), understand that you won't feel happy. You'll only feel like shit knowing that investing real money would have earned you a significant profit. Instead, you'll be crying with your shitty coupon that you can use for a big mac. Unless that actually makes you happy... then more power to you. The point remains that nobody gives a shit."

They believe with the amount Bitcoin needs to go up it’s better to either place the money in some kind of alt coin or even a stock to make it more worth your while? Is there any truth to that? I personally own ETH/BTC at a 50/50 split always plan to do that since i am very high on the two of them long term. I also plan to hold at least for 10-15 years. What do you guys think or am i just thinking into that comment too much?

h0fff8j,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-03 07:47:27,"A different approach: I think you should invest all your savings if you can earn them back by working within a few months. You should also invest in the big altcoins or medium altcoins. here's why:
Let's say you have 3000 dollars of savings. Take out as much as you can to invest in crypto, let's say 2500 dollars. Invest these into a few alts like ADA, VET, ETH and whatever you've analysed to be good. Even if you lose everything, you can do a dayjob and earn the 2.5k back pretty quickly. Otherwise, you might double or triple or more depending on where you take profit! If you lost everything, save up again and try again.
Now if you were succesful and have about 10k dollars now, this is where you put the 3k or a bit more back into more secure assets like gold or even BTC. Now you can diversify your crypto portfolio into 25% risky coins and 50% big altcoins and 25% BTC. Or, if you're like me I think 10k is easily earned back so I take more risk and put all my money into crypto until i have about 50k-100k. At this point I will invest in things like a Blockfi for passive income and other passive income, and keep 50% to play around on the crypto market.
How I approach crypto right now:
1. Have mostly big altcoins and de-fi coins
2. Take 10-25% of your stack when they rise a lot, keep this money aside
3. the money kept aside is to buy big dips like last week
4. keep taking profit until the cycle peak (later this year or early next year)
5. The money kept aside should slowly be invested into BTC until you have about 50% BTC (altcoin season doesn't last long)
6. sell up to 50% of all crypto on the way to the peak. Try to time the peak with the other 50%
7. During the bear market, DCA your monthly earnings (like 300 dollars a month) into projects which you think are promising
I think with this strategy I will go from the 3K (which is now 6k) into 10-15k this cycle, and if I'm lucky 1/5 of a lambo next cycle."

h0fsfjp,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-03 09:42:31,"Yeah, I did buy around $10-15 of crypto when it was about $10 per BTC. I spent it within 2-3 months because to me it was a currency, not an investment. I remember the days, more and more sites were adding crypto payment options and I was hoping to one day use it instead of PayPal.
I got disenchanted with it after seeing people treat it as an investment and a get rich scheme. I might start using it if it stabilizes in price (that is, stop growing) and can be used to pay for things.
I have personally made a vow to never make any profits from crypto. I will use it for currency transfers or like PayPal, if it can ever be used that way."

I lose sleep every night because I could only invest X amount, and yeah... it's great that I got a little extra money to finish the basement, but it could have been ""quit my job living my dream in a Lambo with all my life problems solved"" if I wasn't poor when it was the right time to invest."

You are [GAMBLING] for you. Please don't spend more than you can afford to lose because you feel your [GAMBLE] isn't large enough. I know how it feels to own 1/2 of a coin, visit that coin's subreddit and see people talking about how they just picked up 25 more coins (even though it took me 3 months of DCAing to get half a coin). I quickly realized I [GAMBLED] in something I believe in, and my [GAMBLE] size is right for me. I did at first feel the urge to put more money in so I don't miss out on huge gains, but I need my other fiat and I am NOT okay with losing it. So I didn't gamble.
I think there are a lot of new [GAMBLERS] who can safely afford to lose only small amounts of fiat. I bet there are a lot more than you think. They just don't post about how they picked up $8 more of a coin.

I completely agree that there is nothing wrong with owning very little crypto. Absolutely not.
But if your goal is to make money, you are better off putting your 20$ to the side, and keep doing that until, you have atleast 500$-1000$ so you dont get completely eaten by fees.

h0gfl5h,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-03 12:23:12,Depends how old you are I guess. If I was 18 yeah any amount would be great. If I'm 50 hoping to hit it big and retire a little earlier maybe not. Also depends on your total net worth. If you own a lot of.other investments then 20$ wouldn't mean much even if you are 18.

while 3600 coins would basically mean u have 3600 $ when they hit 1$  
not life changing right.  
while you could have invested in shiba inu few months ago and put 8k on it and walk away with 9 mil now already...  
its the same with most cyrpto, more money makes bigger returns..  
u need an unrealistic moonshot for doge to be bankbreaking for you with 3600 coins sadly.  
i sold my doge, also had to small amount to be worth it :(  
i did buy 20 mil of shiba inu tho very cheap still, those can litterly still go anywhere from 0,01cent - 1$.  
on the other hand i do hope doge gets you what you want and live the life you want.

On the other hand, for someone with a paid off house and a million dollar investment account, a $10,000 crypto investment probably wouldn’t impact their life in any meaningful way.

h0eq3qj,,Comment,5,0,2021-06-03 02:00:22,"True, but keep in mind that the fees involved to get the profit out may outweigh the gains on a relatively small sum.
E.g. a few days ago I decided to use the small amount of ETH (worth about $100) I had in one of my wallets from pool-mining in the past to try out Yearn. The gas fees to move the ETH (from Yearn to Pickle eventually) made that small sum go down by about 60%. I now need to increase the worth of the invested sum by 400% or so to get a similar amount out.

Everyone will recommend it, but it doesn't actually work if you intend on investing the full amount over time anyway. 
For example, after the covid crash (or the recent crypto partial crash), your risk is reduced significantly already. Nothing wrong with going all in if you get a reduced price and believe in future returns. 
I've read a detailed study on this which basically disproves that DCA is in anyway advantageous (on average it is actually worse). 
You cannot believe in the mantra ""time in the market beats timing the market"", then suggest someone buys into a stock/coin over several months; when they could have gone all upfront. 
That said, if you're a noobie to investing and scared to see your portfolio decrease sometimes, DCA is good for mental health. Not really much use for anything more than that though."

The price is picking up again and it will be at the same price you bought it. And in a few months time, it will probably worth more. For any kind of investment there will always be a chance that the investment will drop in price. But if we look at cryptos history, then we can safely say it will keep on growing.
To put in comparison, i put in a sum of money into bitcoin back in 2017 and the price dropped and kept on dropping. So i deleted the app and carried on my life. Big mistake. Fast forward today, my investment had double even after the major correction that i assumed you experienced.
So what i shouldve done instead was just keep investing when the price drops.
So dont feel too bad. Look forward to the future."

I figure this way I'm kind of teaching myself sound investing and somewhat to stop buying stupid shit in the short term so one day I can buy a lot of stupid shit for the rest of my life, or one really big stupid thing. 
Likewise one of the most memorable things I read on bitcoin talk from like 2014? 15? whenever Microsoft started accepting bitcoin was that if he bought something with bitcoin, he also bought that much bitcoin in return. His example was a laptop, and b e understood that he needed to make bitcoin a legitimate spending currency for real gains. And also because he new he was buying a depreciating asset.

I get that you want to try these things and everything, but right now those things just are not practical for such a small amount of ETH. Look into things like impermanent loss. That, in addition to the fees, is going to eat up all your ETH."

>The primary difference between investing and speculating is the amount of risk undertaken. ... High-risk speculation is typically akin to gambling, whereas lower-risk investing uses a basis of fundamentals and analysis.
https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-investing-speculating.asp
It's unfair to paint all cryptocurrencies and all crypto activities with the same risk category. Some crypto stuff can be considered investing (ex. DCA into a sensible mix of top cryptos), while others are pure speculation (ex. going all-in with leveraged trades on some meme coin while shorting BTC because Elon told you it's bad).
If you can't differentiate, then yeah, you're definitely gambling."

h0evhw4,,Comment,52,0,2021-06-03 03:12:28,"Let’s imagine a hypothetical crypto and call it COIN.
COIN is selling for 10 dollars. Great! You want 100 COIN. That means it’s gonna cost you 1,000 dollars.
So you spend 1,000 bucks for 100 COIN in a single transaction.
But over the next 9 days, let’s say COIN goes down 1 dollar each day. So on day 10, COIN is valued at 1 dollar.
You’ve just now basically lost 900 dollars. You own 100 coin with the total value of 100 dollars.
Now let’s DCA into COIN instead. Ten payments of 100 over ten days. Assuming COIN still goes down a dollar a day, if you spent 100 dollars a day in COIN, you will end up with 291.78 COIN! That day 10 price is a steal, because with 100 dollars you’ve actually bought 100 COIN!
So in this scenario, you’ve managed to buy way more than 100 COIN with 1000 dollars.
Alternatively, you can buy 10 COIN a day at its market value. This means you’ve spent 550 dollars for 100 COIN. 
Now this only works if your asset is only going down, obviously if your asset only moves up, you want to go all in up front—but crypto is volatile, so DCA helps you protect against that volatility."
h0fejn4,,Comment,26,0,2021-06-03 07:38:16,"Entire books have been written about DCA investing for stocks. The general idea is to invest like clockwork around the same time, month after month (or week after week, whatever time frame you want). Ignore whether the asset's price is higher or lower; simply keep plugging away.
Sometimes you will buy at a peak, but then after downturns you will get bargains for some weeks/months. And then over time you end up with a low cost basis. 401(k) millionaires have been created this way."
h0fbnoa,,Comment,12,0,2021-06-03 07:05:43,Correct. The idea is that you mitigate your risk when you DCA. This means that you’ll miss out on some potential profit too. It’s a relatively safe and conservative way to enter into a market until you’ve hit your position goal.

h0fn016,,Comment,22,0,2021-06-03 08:58:44,"Correct. This works because the troughs in any asset are generally wider than the peaks. So if you DCA long enough, you are basically guaranteed to have a cost average lower than the average of the asset over that time. Now if you can time a peak for a sale, then you've really done well for yourself. Even if not, selling at a profit is a near certainty over a long enough time span (so long as you're not investing in shitcoins with no real utility)."

I can tell that you have a lot more common sense then most people. It makes me very happy to see that some decent people came along with the Doge-fever. 
Until now, I have been so irritated of all the new idiots. Not because they are new. Just because i have seen a flood of pure idiots with all this Doge crap. Not to name all the idiotic new coins that have been made at the same time.
I wish you the best of luck in the future & with your choices. I may be biased, but VET was a really good pick. I have been with it since January 2018 and i have made a lot of money (for me), by doing a little DCA investing every month. Im not selling for another 10 years though.

Don't let your friend invest in it and dying you do it either."

Please try posting again with the direct link to the article (You shouldn't see ""amp"" anywhere in the URL) or contact the moderators if you need help.
AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.
It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.
For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

Altcoin timetables are different depending on your needs; they can be medium to long term; Ethereum falls here IMO. And the short term; honestly almost any of them qualify because of where we are in the phase of Digital Asset adoption.  
The way I see it; the only mistake that a person can make in 2021 is to be indecisive; that is to say, flip flopping and trading to try and time the market. You will siphon off your gains to the exchange in trading fees and spreads. Hodl is the word. 
Also not buying in at all is the other mistake and it sounds like you’ve dodged that.

I specifically point out that bitcoin CENTRIST is not the same as MAXI. I coined the term after being castrated and crucified by Maxis on Twitter. 
I tried to have a conversation about why it wasn’t ok to use Alts to buy bigger portions of btc. I do see why they feel the way they do but it’s just very narrow minded. In a perfect world? Sure. But,  if the goal and rule (one that I follow orthodoxicly) is never sell your investment once it’s taken the form of Bitcoin, then unless someone’s figured out how to live without money alts are a great way to enhance the economic side of your life that isn’t saving (bitcoin).

h0veu7o,,Comment,9,0,2021-06-06 23:53:22,"Depends on the coin. For example with ADA, I average about 30 ADA each Epoch. There are 73 epochs a year so extrapolated over a year I earn about 2190 ADA a year. 
So then I just gotta decide what my FatFire number is and just divide that number by 2190 to have an estimate of the price ADA has to get to before I reach FatFire.
Obviously the numbers will change as staking rewards change and as my bag gets bigger the amount of rewards I earn will I change so it’s not an exact science to predict. But it’s something that I can track as the time goes by and I continue to DCA"

So right now you earn about 5% for keeping algos in your wallet, but eventually you'll earn around 15% by locking up your algos in their governance system. So you'll lose spending/transfer ability but gain the extra percent. You'll also have to vote on stuff and participate so it's not ideal for all users.

h0vgiwy,,Comment,4,0,2021-06-07 00:10:18,"Good attitude. I found it’s important to make rules for yourself (especially if you still feel unsure and or are new) that will set your future self up for success.  And example is my bit about never touching money that has taken to form of Bitcoin. That is to say if I roll, let’s say, my ETH holdings into my bitcoin and bitcoin immediately plummets. I’m not going to flip flop out and back into ETH. Trades should always be made for a thought out planned reason; chasing gains and trying to time the market is a recipe for losses.  It took me a good 3 months to realize I had no idea what to look for when making these switches and it can be VERY costly with spreads and fees. 
Also something else that can always be repeated until it won’t pertain; One Bitcoin is worth One Bitcoin. The “price” on your app is just a price tag.  I could put a tag on a fist full of diamonds that said “5$”. Does that make the diamond hand (pun intended) only worth 5$? Of course not. 
Fiat price tags are a distraction and if that’s still too much to buy into look at it this way: does it make sense to price one medium of exchange with another medium of exchange? No because that’s basically just an exchange rate, right? You land in Tokyo and you exchange your USD for Yen right there in the airport. 
With that in mind, think about Bitcoins pricing in USD;  corporate players try to scare those interested by saying Bitcoins price is too volatile. Unpredictable and unstable.  No. One bitcoin equals one bitcoin; the volatility rests solely with the price tag. More specifically, the USD. 
It’s the dollar that’s volatile. 
It’s the dollar’s future that is unpredictable and it’s in its current condition of supply multiplication, I’ve yet to see a better example of implied future volatility. 
These thoughts touch on sooo much more than just the fiat volatility.  If this rambling I’ve pieced together interests anyone my DM is always open. 
Being successful with bitcoin is a lot about being above the pitfalls and false signals that fiat literally is designed around. 
Ignore the static. Bitcoins the signal.
Once you come to resonate with this truth it becomes clear that the only way to lose out with bitcoin is by exchanging it for fiat."

The finance minister of Norway, Jan Tore Sanner, suggested in an interview last week that “cryptocurrencies will at some point move past the volatility for which they’re currently known and experience a period of ‘breakthroughs,'” Bloomberg reported. He was quoted as saying:  
  
It is clear that there may be a development over time, whereby you will be able to get more stabilization mechanisms in the currencies that can lead to greater breakthroughs and upheavals in the slightly longer term.  
  
However, he noted that for the time being, cryptocurrency is not a market he would recommend consumers to enter."

The Treasury Department, in its “Greenbook” of revenue proposals released last Friday, proposed a requirement for cryptocurrency brokers, such as exchanges and hosted-wallet providers, to provide information to the IRS on foreign individuals indirectly holding accounts with them.
“They clearly feel that right now there’s a blind spot for foreign owners,” said Jorge Castro, a tax attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who previously worked at the IRS and as a Democratic tax counsel on Capitol Hill. The proposal addresses “certain passive entities and their substantial foreign owners,” the Treasury said.
The U.S. could then provide that information to foreign governments and, in exchange, receive information on any U.S. individuals concealing cryptocurrency assets and dodging their U.S. tax liabilities by using offshore exchanges and wallet providers."""

h0v89x7,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-06 22:49:56,"It's funny because Bitcoin is a currency for the most part, the main thing that makes it hard to use is that transaction times are generally slow and the price can be volatile. But the attributes of a currency are durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. So speed and stability, while major considerations in a currency, haven't thus far been part of the definition.
I don't think the point of most crypto is to replace fiat but there are certainly many people who think it will or should."

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

The ones who don’t have to worry about making rent or paying bills. So they can sit on this stuff for 10 years and it doesn’t matter. Another example of right thinking, but taken over by the wrong people. Crypto is long past “for everyone” it’s for the people who have all the money and can manipulate the market, like they want to with the stock market, but new enough to where they have the ability to. We are literally just making new hedge funds. This is what they want. I like the idea of crypto, hate how it’s changed hands from the people to the mega rich. Everything crypto was suppose to be is gone. I also think crypto might crash the economy. And if crypto is valued based on the dollar..how will that all work out? Is the whole purpose to crash the dollar and start a new 1 world currency?
I’m happy for the normal people that have made money, but I don’t think it’s for normal people anymore. This is now a rich person hobby to brag about how much you have to your other rich friends.
Just how I’ve thought for the last 3/4 years.
For me, I won’t buy any crypto. I missed the boat on the buying. Knew about it in 2010 bc of Silk Road, but didn’t think it would turn to this because of the illegal part. But I guess that’s what people liked about it. But even if I would have invested in 2010 there’s no way i would have held until now. I would have doubled/tripled my money and moved on to the next investment.
But I would trade goods I’m selling from my business for it, and hold it on the business books. Use it as a selling point when selling my business. But that’s about it. 
Your thoughts?
I like hearing different points of view and Reddit is great for that."

h1147zh,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-08 10:14:51,"I agree with a lot of what you are saying but I still think crypto has potential for more than just rich people.  A few years ago a friend of mine was able to get out of his manual labor type job and make way more money than I by day trading Bitcoin.  
I am suspicious about El Salvador’s plunge into Bitcoin. It would be so tempting to make them a new “Panama Papers” type situation where uber rich park their money, launder it, evade taxes that the rest of us have to pay.  
Crypto is so much more than just a “store of value” though. You should look into Cardano- it is still half baked but if it comes out as advertised it has the potential to put economic advantages into the hands of many people in the world who live in corrupt countries where the local currency fluctuates like Bitcoin on the regular.  Plus there is (at this moment in time), only one “whale” wallet address that controls a significant amount of tokens (1.5%) - much less than ETH or BTC.  Time will tell."

nu1rm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nu1rm7/grandma_wants_to_invest_but_i_think_its_a_scan/,Grandma wants to “invest” but I think it’s a scan,16,54,2021-06-06 22:25:14,"Title says it. Girlfriend’s grandmother called from Philippines telling us to use her debit and buy bitcoins from a Bitcoin atm. Gave us the guy’s number to get his a wallet code. We tried calling and he sounds like he’s coming out of sedation and we hear our voice echo a lot, can’t understand him at all but he texts no problem. Keeps texting if we’re depositing the money yet and seems to have JUST learned the kiosks only accept cash. He previously said they accept card.
We brought all this up to G-ma and she says yes it’s a gamble but her friend told her about it and she trusts him. Said she’ll get $2000 in return for her $1000 investment.
I don’t trust any of this. Am I right in this being a scam? I don’t know much about any of this.
Sorry for the block of text.
TL;DR: old friend contacts old lady, says contact “Dave” he’ll take your $$ and give you $$$$. Shady sounding guy, impatient about money. Is this a scam?
Update: Didn’t buy or send any BTC. Just told her we couldn’t withdrawal money in that amount right now. Screen shot a few of your responses so she sees other people’s views on this. Also, “Dave” keeps calling our phone. He’s blocked now. 
Thanks for the reassurance. I never felt good about it."

If your grandma ask for explanation, you should come with clear answer. She won't believe you if you just saying it's scam.
This is not the best answer, but it's still better than no answer. Tell her, the ""real financial advisor"" won't promising how big your return will be. It's better to trust company than individual. Company that backed by government is better. Moreover, if someone asking to send money, don't. ""The real advisor"" will allow you to use your own wallet.
For example: I could advise you to buy Bitcoin, eth, matic right now. But I can't promise you how big your return will be."

There was a scam similar to this in the states where people were asking people to go to Bitcoin ATMs and buy it in cash and send to specified wallets. If you do not have the key to the wallet in question it is not your wallet. In essence it’s the same as someone asking you to go to the ATM and have them cash to hold for you in their wallet promising gains later. 
They even had people going to these Bitcoin ATMs and posting flyers warning people about such a scam.

The way Bitcoin keeps track of whether C is now allowed to spend that amount, requires the ability to verify the whole transaction chain that occured previously.

You can potentially apply a generic rule of say of 10 yrs, cutting out moves now seen as redundant as you say.
I feel the issue is that if it hasn't been designed from day zero as that approach then it really shouldn't be retroactively applied as who is to stay that data is needed or not.
Maybe the folks at r/CryptoTechnology can help, as there are a few Devs on there."
h0vfcij,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-06 23:58:29,"I wouldn't consider myself a developer, or even a programmer really but I'm a decent coder.
When we talk about redundancy we are referring to each copy of the blockchain, not that data inside the blockchain. Every block and each transfer is unique and identifiable, otherwise you wouldn't be able to send bitcoin. There is no need to store redundant data on a blockchain.
Now if there is no need to store previous data for whatever reason, like you don't need to identify previous transfers because the bitcoin is located elsewhere on the chain, then you could get rid of it. You wouldn't be able to trace the unique history of the bitcoin but it wouldn't be necessary.
Basically as soon as data isn't needed it technically becomes redundant and can be removed from the chain. For bitcoin, determining a safety margin is impossible because satoshis coins haven't been transferred. If you go through the ledger you wouldn't be able to remove many blocks at all."

h0vte6w,,Comment,7,0,2021-06-07 02:47:44,"I don’t believe any of this.  I’ve worked for three FANG companies and personal HR info is always accessible. You review all of the HR paperwork and verify those details.  In all cases the recruiters never submitted my paperwork directly rather they provide me links.  Also, these companies conduct one or more phone screenings, they would have known where you live based on your phone number.  Plus the screen shared coding interviews wold log your IP.  If you interviewed on-site you wold have to schedule a flight.  No way a FANG company wouldn’t have known where you live.
Also, it’s dubious that a recruiter would do what you said.  Developers are falling over themselves to land interviews with these companies, a recruiter has zero incentive to forge data."

> Taproot is a bundle of several improvement proposals. Notable among them, it would add data efficiencies that could ease supply-side pressure in Bitcoin’s transaction-fee market. It also includes updates to multi-signature transactions, a Bitcoin feature that is significant for custodians and other organizations that take direct custody of bitcoin.
They talk about some issues with the new multi-signature option not being useful unless it is widely used. Their main point about how it is not like gold is basically that Gold isn't tech and tech is always changing and updates risk affecting adoption and price."

To be fair, he is free to tweet whatever he wants, right? Also, he did not single-handedly crash the market. Videos like these give him what he wants the most - attention.
The ""average working person"" should not see crypto as a get-rich-quick scam but something they should DCA towards and grow exponentially overtime. If you cannot deal with volatility, you should not invest in crypto at all. 
Your financial discipline is your responsibility, no one has the right to tell you what to do with your money and shouldn't be blamed because your investment strategy was stupid."

Not financial advice, but 70% of my capital are put into the big two, BTC and ETH. The exact weightage of these coins in your portfolio will vary depending on your risk tolerance.
I would then use the leftover 30% to play around with smaller high cap coins that have strong support and has great potential. ADA, VET, XRP come into mind here.
And finally, it doesn't matter if you start with 1k, 3k or even a 100. A 100% gain is still a 100% gain."

It's an interesting coin as in it's like POS but you don't have to stake it in a pool. 
You just buy it and you'll gradually get more the longer you hold. It comes from the tax from each transaction which is 10% total (5% to Liquidity, 5% to holders).
But I'll say this, it looks like a copy paste from either HOGE or FEG (tokensniffer), but it looks the Safemoon team is upgrading the token to fix some issues with exchange compatibility.
I know all this from being early on the coin.

It will come down to who continues to move forward with R&D and who can actually be a everyday currency for the people which is what crypto is all about. Most people just look at crypto as an investment and never buy or sell anything with crypto. Some Cryptos gas fees are so high that it’s impossible to use it as actual currency. Ethereum is beginning to get there fees down but If it cost you an extra 30.00 in fees  to do a 30.00 transaction then that is not a viable currency solution.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""
""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I am also willing to wager that this move from Nayib Bukele may be a factor that reduces future violence and crime in El Salvador.

It isn’t a nice or glamorous life. They have a per capita murder rate 7 times higher than the US despite a population roughly 1/60th the size. Gang rivalry and the subsequent violence permeate every layer of El Salvadoran society, and is a large reason many El Salvadorans try to flee to the US. 
Reading this thread makes me laugh, the fools here thinking the IRS is the biggest crook they’ve ever seen and then thinking falling under the ersatz authority of MS13 would be preferable. Some articles describe El Salvador as “the worlds most dangerous place that is not a warzone”. 
Not to mention, the country is absolutely riddled with corruption. With the IRS, you can always know where you stand, and how much you will owe. In El Salvador, you may know your *official* tax rate, but good luck predicting how much you’re going to have to pay in protection racket fees and bribes. 
El Salvador might not be the last country on Earth I’d choose to put any money in to, but it’s definitely languishing near the bottom of that list. If someone is seriously considering renouncing US citizenship to settle in El Salvador, make *real damn sure* you do your homework. There’s a reason people try to flee that place."

Most likely they will get alot of benefits...
Inofficially most of them are still US citizens and I don't think you have to renounce your citizenship to move abroad. As a citizen they can still travel to and stay in US for as long as possible. Meaning they could still own a house in US and ""inofficially"" live there, but ""work"" in El Salvador and pay taxes there. I'm not a US citizen but I fail to see how they would be any different from other countries.
Most of these tax havens used to be poor countries with rampant crime until they became havens for ultra rich people and with the benefit & help from these people they turned the countries around.

I hope anybody contemplating this, or going to any 'low tax high freedom' place run by an opaque oligarchy (that newcomers will *not* be joining), is ready to organize their own security.
The naivety of some of the libertarian boys around here is breathtaking. Taxes and the social contract in advanced nations buy us the security and legal recourse we all take for granted.
Y'all like to bitch and complain that *your* money is being *stolen* and *wasted* on the poor and the lazy. But see how it goes for you if you're attacked in a developing nation and your shit is stolen, or something even worse happens.
The rich and powerful in developing nations are plugged into vast social networks and can flex their muscles to protect themselves. But even they are paranoid enough to live in fortress compounds and make sure their kids are always accompanied by bodyguards.
Some birdshit Westerner who turns up with a just hard-on for Ayn Rand and a couple of mil that he thinks should make him a king amongst the locals... well, you get the idea."

But at the same time there is a glimmer of hope for reformation, in light of all the news upon crypto (I hope adoption will be beyond bitcoin, of course.) 
For an example of how this hits home, my uncle can send back money to the partner and child without not get hit with a 10% fee from the bank."

h0vp31f,,Comment,87,0,2021-06-07 01:48:56,"You would have to pay an exit tax and renounce USA citizenship to set yourself up for favorable taxation with another citizenship going forward.
USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea are the only countries to impose world wide taxation on its citizens. Americans will have no benefit to the taxation policy in El Salvador.  
For example, if I wanted to live full time in El Salvador because they have 0% capital gains on bitcoin… As an American living in El Salvador, I would still owe the same capital gains to the USA regardless that I don’t live in the USA.
  
If I were anything aside from a USA, Myanmar, or Eritrean citizen… let’s say for example, a Canadian living in El Salvador, I would owe 0% capital gains across the board, because Canada does not impose world wide taxation on its citizens like how the USA does, and El Salvador again has 0% capital gains on bitcoin.
  
It doesn’t matter that Canada has high capital gains taxes on bitcoin for its domestic citizens in Canada. Since there is no world wide taxation imposed by Canada, Canadians have the freedom to avoid Canada’s taxes by choosing to live in another country with more favorable taxes.
  
Only USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea impose world wide taxation on its citizens, and we have zero ability to avoid those taxes, which is pretty fucked up and authoritarian.
  
It really sucks that the USA imposes world wide taxation. As an American, all I want is freedom from worldwide taxation, full stop. It’s not much to ask for considering every other country in the world does it that way. (Aside from Myanmar and Eritrea). For someone like me, renunciation of USA citizenship is the only practical solution to avoid unfair and unjustifiable world wide taxation."
h0ve4dr,,Comment,38,0,2021-06-06 23:46:12,USA has an exit tax of a little more than 20 percent on anything over 2 million or so I believe. They're going to get their pound of flesh.
h0vw8a9,,Comment,32,0,2021-06-07 03:30:04,"It's actually pretty funny USA people ask this on reddit.  If you're ACTUALLY rich from crypto find a very good accountant, your tax burden will be reduced.  In the rest of the world USA is considered a tax haven of sorts themselves.  Wealthy people pay much less than the peasants percentage wise, you can just stay there and possibly start some companies there or overseas and reduce your amounts, your accountant will guide you.
While there are countries with smaller cap gains you're still bound by your citizenship to pay up to the IRS no matter how far you go and for how long, otherwise you must revoke citizenship and pay anyway lest be turned into a criminal and be relegated to a network of countries with no extradition.  
Having said all that, if you're looking for a country with no cap gains El Salvador is a pretty awful choice.  High crime rate and you'll be isolated and always in danger from cartels.  UAE for instance also has no cap gains, at all, it's very safe and full of rich people you could be friends with.

That said, if you were in a place with foreign taxes you're paying too, I think there's a mechanism for those to offset what you would pay to the US, possibly down to 0."
h0xbk0i,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-07 12:29:34,I’d just like to point out that a much easier way to avoid cap gains is to move to puerto rico where you can stay in the us and avoid capital gains taxes when you are a full time resident.

USA is one of the few (the only?) country that still requires you to pay US taxes for money you make abroad even if you never bring it back to the USA.  
You can negotiate with the IRS to pay less if you prove you already paid TAX in the other country.

Currently he's been building the country back up. Hospitals, tons of school investments, laptop and internet for people that are studying, heavy investments into education. Rebuilding water lines, putting electrical lines under ground etc. Investing in tourism and airports, helping neighbouring countries during the heavy storms, being able to properly negotiate with the US, China and Russia, something previous leaders been completely incapable of. He was already massively rich and says the money is there for all these things. Not just talks, just in yhe ladt two years there's been a ton of change. He's been getting rid of the old corrupted assholes in the government.

Capital gains (like trading stocks or cryptocurrency) and passive income (like rental property cash flow) IS NOT earned income and does not qualify. Sometimes there might be a tax credit for some kinds of income types, depending on the country you are in and if that specific country has some kind of deal with the USA to save you from being ""double taxed"".

You’re much better off applying for citizenship somewhere over in Europe if you renounce your USA citizenship, after becoming a citizen of El Salvador and waiting any time constraints. Granted, there’s much easier ways to avoid taxes when you have “I need to avoid US taxes money.”
I’ve scene multiple posts saying “move to “somewhere” else in South America.” If you have dodging tax money concerns, you need to get out of South America as quickly as possible. It’s not that you won’t survive; It’s you likely won’t survive as a foreigner if you choose to live the lifestyle that comes with that money. 
Having traveled overseas a few times, Croatia (Zadar) was by far my favorite place I traveled to where most spoke English. Probably 70% of people I attempted to speak with knew some English.

Plus, it is helping the investors or businesses which benefit from moving there or taking advantage of their policies in some way.
And finally, there's always a positive political externality in regulatory and tax arbitrage. It's about the only thing which provides any pressure on nation states towards accountability to their citizens.
All of that said; its of course possible that what this guy and his government do with an inflow of cash might be more corrupt and harmful than all of these benefits put together.
So, it's an empirical question that I don't think a single person here is qualified to even see the outline of all the factors (what I brought up just scratches the surface, I'm sure, yet was a more thoughtful analysis than anyone else here as even attempted), let alone have pertinent data on similar circumstances to draw any kind of conclusions about what's going to happen with this.

In so many words, and to simplify it, almost all of the countries were purposefully given loans that were basically ""payday loans"" - that the U.S. knew wouldn't be able to be paid back monetarily, but would be paid back politically, corruptively, and, essentially, illegally. The huge sums of money were given to people that were known to be fraudsters and grifters - it was known they'd embezzle most of it, but use some of it to build the oil plant, a token school, a few roads, or whatever - but then also mansions for their friends, transfers out of country, paying local militias/gangs to kill competitors, etc... then, also, they'd be propped up politically and do the required bidding, etc... by/of the U.S. government nutcases. 
If the U.S. really wanted to have helped Central America over the decades, they could have. Easier said than done, of course, but much of the policy was purely selfish and of the corrupted variety. 
Much of the same is going on in Africa right now, but with China giving out the ""loans."""

The reason is that even if they _did_, it would almost always be the case that you were already paying taxes in that foreign country, and the IRS wouldn't be able to demand taxes from you anyway for that reason.

h18o00i,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-09 23:45:10,">how exactly would it?           
There are a lot of ""astrological"" numbers that people throw out there that bitcoin could go to. I'm under the impression that it will go to seven figures within our lifetimes, and I think the earliest this would happen is 10 years from now.              
However, some people are thinking that, based on this last week alone, we could be in the middle of a ""Latin American Spring."" I definitely think it's too early to say that. But if this really takes off with nations adopting bitcoin as legal tender, then the use case will only grow in terms of adoption at the very least as a store of value or hedge against inflation.              
However, a lot of this, admittedly, hinges on the success of the lightning network. Imagine making 19,000 USD a year as a doctor over there.           
https://teleport.org/cities/san-salvador/salaries/              
TL;DR - technological improvements and further price appreciation in bitcoin as well as families using bitcoin to send international remittances back to El Salvador from pretty much everywhere else on Earth, and adoption from its latin american neighbors."

Basically if you lived in the us for 3 years with out leaving , you're hooked for taxes the next 3 years. 
If it was less than you might be able to get our earlier.but since the subject is about people most likely living in the US
I just wanted to let them know , you will not get out easy. 
The only exception in the rule are students , they can once they leave fail the test, because it doesn't apply while they're outside the US and not comeback at any point after they end their studies, in a period that will make them pass the test. So leave for 3 years so you don't pay taxes , but these are foreign students not US citizens , so not relative to our subject

Even if you’re expecting an inheritance larger than that, getting that $ now and reinvesting will help offset later taxes.

But you're missing the fact that private security and gated communities are a pretty easy and reliable solution for many well-off people in many corrupt or crime-ridden parts of the world.
I'm not saying that that means that you're wrong and investors are going to flock down there...I'm just saying that other factors are bigger and law enforcement or security is actually pretty cheap...its just that governments are so terribly bad at providing everything, including policing and law enforcement, that it becomes a problem in all but the richest countries which can afford the very high costs of government bezel and corruption and political failure, and still overpay for police."

Fixed that for you. The US rate is per 100k people as well. It's a *rate*, total population doesn't matter.
This means that El Salvador has about 15 times more murders per capita than the US. The US have about 50 times the population of El Salvador. So the answer is no, El Salvador doesn't have more daily murders than the US. It has 3-4 times less.

Blockchain will show exactly what wallet you send the crypto to.  
Technically, they don't know who owns that wallet, but if you a little later cash out that same wallet then it is pretty easy to figure out...
Every time you convert real money to crypto or vice versa, they can see you and link you to the wallet you are using at the time.  
The blockchain on the other hand never knows who you are, but always know exactly which wallet has sent money to where and when.  
Put those 2 together and staying anonymous isn't that simple.
At the least you would need to split the money up and circulate it over several wallets to make it look like there was some real traffic going on."

I think Ecuador actually has a treaty but refuses to extradite.  That's the weird thing with treaties, firstly they are specific to a list of crimes in the provisions and nothing outside of them, secondly they are not always executed.  On the other hand, it can be that a country without a treaty will send you off anyway because of politics.  It's a tricky subject.  Polanski basically raped a minor in the US, France has a treaty, but he lives there a free man.  Probably specifics of that treaty prevent extradition.
As for the other countries that's kind of irrelevant but yeah there's a lot of them, out of 194 there are something like 60 or 70 that don't have a treaty and a good number of them I don't imagine US citizens would want to live in just to avoid tax LOL.  Although I think countries like Iceland and Switzerland are pretty nice.

Yup, Layer-2 payment networks are required for scaling globally.  You'll never scale to hundreds of billions of txs a day while needing every single network participant to store a copy of it all and verify it all.  Growing in layers is the only way this tech can scale to that level.
> and not secure.
Well, that's just simply wrong.  You sound like you don't really understand how Lightning works at all.  Which is fine, but don't go criticizing something you don't understand.  That's just ignorant.
Lighting channels are just voluntary agreements between 2 parties to keep updating a single tx, then only broadcast a settlement to the blockchain at an agreed upon time.  Every Lightning tx is a valid Bitcoin tx.  The participants simply agree to not broadcast it yet.  Either party may choose to break the agreement at any time by broadcasting the tx.  That closes their channel.  There is no inherent trust or middleman.  Every channel is secure, and anyone can close their channel and get their funds back, even without cooperation from their peer on the other end of the channel.
I have no problem helping people learn, but you guys have to stop attacking things you clearly don't understand.  Why are the loudest Lightning critics always the most ignorant?  It's a shame."

Stop trying to convince others that El Salvador is a safe place to be or live.
""about 1,387,000 Salvadorans lived in the United States, making them the largest Central American immigrant.""
 If things were getting better for the citizens of El Salvador 21% of their population wouldn't have immigrated to America.

""Around 4,000 murders a year occur on the streets of El Salvador, with gangs taking control of many areas. The country's capital, San Salvador, is where most of the violent attacks take place, but some areas are obviously more at risk than others.
Try to stay away from downtown San Salvador – parts of Soyapango, Apopoa and its surroundings on the east side of the city, as well as Mejicanos. These districts attract criminal activity, and are not safe places to go.
To give you an idea of how dangerous things can get, these street gangs aren't the type that just carry pocketknives. Many have access to military style weapons, such as hand grenades and automatic guns – and they're not afraid to use them.
There have been grenade attacks on buses, restaurants, and businesses, which have killed dozens of people, including children. Foreigners have also been killed in these kinds of attacks. Buses are often sprayed with bullets, due to gangs demanding protection money from bus companies.
Robberies and muggings are also common on buses and other forms of public transport. Passengers are frequently robbed en-route, at roadblocks, and at bus stops.
Locals have warned about the area surrounding the Tica bus station, where Hotel San Carlos is located. This is an area notorious for violent street crimes. Avoid walking alone around here, even during the day. If you need to go to the Tica bus station, it's best to take a taxi."

This is way more nuanced than my simplistic statement, but you better believe this is possible. My rule is simple, keep your KYC'd coins separate from your non KYC'd coins and you will be a happy camper."

A US citizen can go live in the arctic for 50yrs, until he/she revokes that citizenship they are still a citizen to their death, amd they still owe cap gains lol.  Maybe you're under the impression that to obtain a citizenship in El Salvador you have to go live there, I wouldn't be so sure, as an immigrant myself I can tell you a lot of shit goes right out the window when you're coming with lots of money.
As for going there as a US citizen to cash out your crypto, sure do that.  I was merely responding to someone complaining that they'd have to live there, which isn't true.  Either way, if I was a US citizen I wouldn't pull any of that shit, it's tax evasion and a very lazy way to do it at that.  Just hire a good accountant and reduce your amounts and enjoy your freedom."

I never said ""hate"" learn to read. But fear based on ignorance, yes: ""it's dangerous in South America and Mexico, and Central America!"" meanwhile you're more likely to be robbed in the USA than Russia.
I never denied these are opinions, so you can relax and feel less offended now (which is funny to me). And my friends aren't \[overtly at least\] xenophobic they just aren't socially educated or aware of the importance to travel the world as much as I seen other western nations being. Yet, it's common for Americans to have prejudices of other nations that date back to the Cold War.

They sue you, serve you, you don't show up, judge enters a default judgement. The take that judgement to the country you're in and most first-world countries will honor it and then enter the judgement locally, resulting in the seizure of your assets locally. Has nothing to do with it being a US bank or anything like that. The judgement gets enforced where the assets are located.
Unless the judgement is from a shady country where the court has reason to believe the judgement cannot be trusted, then they will likely honor it. This is like a cornerstone of global trade and law in the developed world."

Such an over explanation was unnecessary when in fact you compared two different circumstances; one being government and the other being individual.You can simply look it up, tax fraud is one of the things foreign nations simply do not seem pressing enough to involve their law enforcement and courts - with FEW exceptions, UK being one. It'd take underhanded tactics to get to those people if deemed necessary, which isn't beneath the US government who allows an illegal agency to police citizens in the first place (IRS).
You come off as a normal American; privileged and presumptuous. Russia is merely one of the 90 countries unlikely to bother with American internal issues (no extradition laws). And while socially has issues, beginning to look better than USA everyday actually, still one of the few countries that doesn't allow the USA government to overreach with their hypocritical foreign policies.

h0vp94e,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-07 01:51:08,"So you think the federal unemployment boost should remain forever.
>Do you support the working class being able to live off of their wages?
No, because I don't think it's realistic. It also seems like a short term solution that won't matter once more and more jobs are automated in 5-10 years time.
I'm pro-development, so I'm hoping if we continue to build more housing in Texas, that cost of living won't go up too high.  Unfortunately, people are clamoring at the teeth to live in my city, so even with all the new housing construction, houses are still being built.
>(yeah right, Texas doing something for anyone but the 1%? Not gonna happen. Idiots wouldn’t even take free money to weatherize their power grid and instead let people freeze to death)
I wonder how many states would be able to handle the intense summer heats that we handle with ease in Texas.  I'd be curious to see how New York would survive multiple days of 100 degree weather.
[Yikes](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/weather/2020/07/upstate-ny-will-swelter-in-weeklong-heat-wave-and-it-wont-stop-there.html).  It looks like last year they experienced pathetic 90 degree temperatures and there were threats of wildfires and droughts.  How come those idiots can't handle a few days of mild summer temperatures?"

>  
>Charging people thousands of dollar utility bills in order to stay alive, vs idiots starting wildfires in drought ridden areas, hmmm… which does a state have more control over.
How come Texas doesn't have to worry about droughts when the temperatures hit 90 degrees for a couple of days?
[Dallas has 74 days when the weather is above 90 degrees.  New York has a measly 11.](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/number-hot-days-cities-summer.php)
>So, you are saying, it is not realistic for our society to have people able to live off of their wages, despite corporate profits at all time highs and the largest concentration of wealth into the upper class in the history of our society.. it sounds like our system is inherently exploitative if it requires on an impoverished working class while having an elite class that makes so much money they could literally spend a hundred million dollars a day and still come out with more wealth than they started with at the end of the year.
I can't think of a realistic solution.  I suppose we could pay people more, but I believe that prices would simply go up everywhere, so we'd be right back to square one.  Also, paying people more just encourages companies to automate/outsource quicker.
I'd love to hear your solution though."

I bought a mini-basket of Eth, BTC and Doge on the morning before Elon’s SNL appearance. There was a small bump across all these assets in the 48 hours that followed. It was a heady intro to the crypto space, checking my phone regularly and seeing the ticker numbers on the app blur green and rise every thirty seconds or so. My executive function recognises the Brain Stimulation Reward structures lying beneath this feeling and the implications for motivating behaviour; release of dopamine-containing neurons along the mesolimbic system. 
My swiping finger didn’t care. There then was a post-Elon dip which was unexpected, but I knew that sweet green would be returning soon. It didn’t, and anyone reading this will be very familiar with the past month’s flash crashes and depressed prices. 
 
It felt like running into a burning temple, hearing the old stories of reverent glory for the bull-god but that culture having no relationship to the torching I was witnessing now. I could have exited with my losses at that stage and taken the Classic Crypto Cautionary Tale into social situations: “I was in crypto for a bit but it’s the Wild West, don’t get in, too volatile.” Instead, I started researching some of the projects, and it struck me how the mainstream media’s “Crypto has no value” thing was infantile-ignorant. This is the future of finance, and to leave now would be complicit in furthering that narrative.
I’ve started now with some small purchases of coins and tokens in DeFi, because the more I read the more certain I am that now is akin to the introduction of the automobile one hundred years ago. You could have bought shares in Ford or continued to buy buggy whips; for me the choice is that binary.
I’m glad I’m still in and will continue to buy more crypto at these lower prices. I have no guarantee any of my coins will go to the moon, but it’s still exciting to be a participatory witness to history.

I'm sure that I'm one of the many here but 99% of the projects I'm holding coins for had already been in existence for months or years before I buy in and while they may be new to my exchange they aren't knew.
Now I know early has more risk but can anyone suggest where I can find new projects to read up on or invest in that aren't scams?
I'd love to take a small percentage of my portfolio and invest it into new and interesting coins but I just don't know how :(
Thanks all 👍"
h1l40oq,,Comment,4,0,2021-06-12 23:45:06,"You could always go to a site like Coingecko and scroll down to the lower-cap projects. Many of the coins on there have a little blurb about the project to give you an idea of their goals. Of course, you should probably look deeper than just the description but it can be a good starting point."
h1l4ebb,,Comment,5,0,2021-06-12 23:48:54,"Other exchanges outside of the united states (assuming youre in the US) have more coin options. Coingecko is a good app to install and track various newer projects. I seriously don't trust wiring money to random banks in europe and apac to allow you to buy things that arent on coinbase yet (they dont have a direct deposit option).
What I do is buy USDT or some commonly accepted current like eth or btc via coinbsse then take that asset (after it clears) and deposit it another exchange like kucoin. After that asset is transferred to kucoin all purchases are instant. Kucoin is based in HongKong, Id highly recommend after you make purchases of these coins move them to metamask or some other wallet. In general, dont store stuff on exchanges but on the sites outside US id be extra careful. Make sure you ensble 2FA also. Kucoin is not the only company out there that does this but they didnt give me shit because im american"

h1l7w43,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 00:26:58,"I would recommend monitoring new Uniswap listings.  There are Telegram groups you can join that will alert you to new Uniswap listings. 
Keep in mind, the vast majority of coins added to Uniswap are fake coins and/or scam coins.  So you have to do some DD, check etherscan, check the web, see if you can find confirmation that the coin is legit.
The thing is, through this process, by researching fake tokens, you will end up learning about real projects with upcoming IDOs (i.e. the token is fake but the name corresponds to a real project).  And, that one time you come across a legit coin, and get in early, you might profit immensely.  
For example, check out SPRAY, which was stealth launched on Uniswap yesterday:
https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x304872a6d0faf474a7d8e43d874880a5199a4e34
It rose 13,000% yesterday.  Had you been aware - you might not have purchased, because it seemed a bit sketchy at launch.  And had you bought, you probably would have sold well before it did 130x.  But..."

h1nmou5,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 16:03:47,"It's kind of complicated, and I don't have a tutorial to link to.  But any coin being listed on Uniswap is an ERC coin.  If you pull it up on Uniswap's website, or on DexTools, it'll give you a link to the etherscan page.  Etherscan is an ETH explorer and you can view the coin's contract and any transactions related to it.  For each coin there's a ""token tracker"" page and a ""contract"" page.  They link to one another.
Token tracker will show you the total supply and all token transactions.  Smart contract page shows contract interaction.  On the smart contract page, there's a ""Contract"" tab towards the bottom.   If there is no contract submitted to etherscan, that usually but not necessarily indicates a scam (SPRAY initially had no contract on etherscan and it turned out to be legit).  If the contract's name is SimpleERC20, for example, the token was created using a free token generator; it would often, but not always indicate a scam.  At the top of the page it shows the ""contract creator,"" the wallet of the person who paid ETH to create the contract.  Often, this wallet is newly created and has received ETH from a separate address.  If you click on that address, you might see that this person removed liquidity (i.e. rugged) elsewhere before creating a new coin.  That's obviously a red flag.  
There's no exact science to it."

As of now, there is no purpose for Moons on [r/Cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocurrency/) other than paying 10x more for a monthly membership. The tipping feature is nice, but it is rarely used due to the potential loss of eligibility for the 20% bonus. Users should be allowed to tip up to 10% of moons received in the previous distribution before losing eligibility for the 20% bonus for keeping their moons in their vault.
One argument against this change is the idea that users might use this to sell their moons while retaining eligibility for the bonus on the next distribution. By capping the amount of moons withdrawn to 10% of the previous distribution, the effect will be greatly reduced. The increase in attention due to the new use case of tipping users for providing good discussion should make up for this as well.

h1m8453,,Comment,68,0,2021-06-13 08:46:45,"I think this was already proposed but didn't make it, because the percentage gave an unfair advantage for whales and big moon farmers to abuse it.
Using a percentage means Moon whales can tip themselves so much more and on a second account and be able to sell a lot more Moons without any penalty and without losing the bonus.
While people without as many moons can't do that, or didn't have any moons in the last distribution can't tip much or can't tip at all.
It should be the same number for everyone to be fair, like 100 moons a month for everyone."

h1mz4rz,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 12:51:55,"I see some misunderstanding in people regarding the '10% tipping proposal'.  
  
**Explaining the '10% tipping proposal'**  
  
Currently you get a 20% bonus for just holding your moons earned last round in your vault.  
  
Let's say you earned 100 moons last round. If you tipped 10 moons out of those 100 moons, your bonus would decrease proportionally - to 18%.  
  
If the new proposal gets accepted in 4 days, there will appear a door for up to 10% of moons to exit the vault with all of us paying for full 20% bonuses."

h1nwg6r,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 17:23:08,"reposting my comment from last month as it didn't get much visibility:
this proposal seems misleading – you don't lose eligibility for 20% bonus by tipping moons, you lose a few percent of the 20% bonus IF your vault balance is lower than your last distribution reward
example: your balance is 300 at the time of snapshot, last distribution you've got 100 – that means you can tip 200 without losing the bonus. if you tip 225 then you'll get a smaller 15% bonus since your balance will be 75 out of 100 (3/4 ratio)"

If the amount of moons allowed to be tipped is fixed like a 100 moons, then in the near future that will actually become more than 10% of the amount most people receive, and that fixed amount will have to be changed manually on a consistent basis with new polls.

h1l43vg,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-12 23:45:58,Cardano is the easiest to stake completely risk free doesn't leave your wallet so instead of sitting in you exchange it can sit in Yoroi wallet (or others) and make small gains
h1l31cm,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-12 23:35:04,"The very short version is that you deposit or otherwise restrict coins as like a security deposit promising that you (or someone with whom you aligned) will faithfully verify transactions. If you cheat or try to attack the network, your deposit gets burned (""slashed""). If you do a good job, you get ""rewards"" (which is basically interest).
Each proof of stake coin has a different mechanism. For example, you can instantly ""bond"" your coins on Polkadot through Ledger Live, pick some big validator to align your coins with (people you trust who doesn't take a big cut) and start earning rewards the next day.
 For example, I get about 13% APR/14% APY on Polkadot, instantly added to my account. That means about 0.3 DOT per 1,000 DOT staked, every day. After a year, 1,000 DOT would grow to about 1,140 DOT.  Of course, if the value of DOT also increases, it's gravy.
Polygon, Solana, Ethereum and others all encourage staking and have different time periods and rewards. You can either figure out how to do it yourself, or stake on an exchange you trust (for lower rewards).
Also, you can ""cold stake"" some coins. I stake DOT and SOL from my Ledger (cold offline wallet). I stake MATIC from MetaMask (hot wallet)."
h1l4i2n,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-12 23:49:56,"Yes, Cardano too. Lower APY, but easy. You can stake Sol, MATIC, and DOT too without giving up custody. Ethereum is harder. You're either using an exchange or locking your coins."

h1ldphf,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 01:35:45,"Actually this is a huge misconception in crypto. Market cap only matters for companies on the stock market because before that company becomes public, it gets valued and that's used to determine the number of shares and share price i.e. market cap.
A cryptocurrency can have whatever the fuck market cap it wants. ADA for example has a market cap of $50b but it sure as hell is not worth $50b. There exists a certain amount of ADA tokens which people are willing to pay $1.5 for so its market cap is now $50b.
Hopefully now you see the issue. A public company's share price is somewhat restricted by its market cap because you can't have its price go 100x because people know the company isn't worth 100x its current value. 
In crypto, that value is pure speculation. No one can really say that ADA is actually worth $50b and not $100b or $200b, so that market cap is purely determined by what people are willing to pay for the token.
And psychologically speaking, it's much easier for someone to be willing to pay 0.000015 for a token that's currently at 0.00001 than they would be willing to pay 75k for a token currently at 50k."

That’s all that “hedge against inflation” means.
Likewise, as a “store of value” crypto sucks. Sure, it’s absolutely fantastic for long term hodling, but over the short term? Or even mid-term? No way. The fact that it can crash 90% and stay down for months or years makes it a shitty mid/short term store of value. There are other assets that are far better options, including *dun-dun-dunnnnn* the US Dollar, which is the undisputed *best* store of value over the short term.
Crypto is an amazing technology with tons of potential, but it’s not magical."
h1l932d,,Comment,5,0,2021-06-13 00:40:16,"While I do agree with the sentiment that crypto is no magical and is sometimes overhyped, I think you’re undermining a lot of aspects that make it promising as an asset.
You’ve loosely defined *hedge against inflation* as something that appreciates in value but the point is that—for many reasons—some assets like crypto does a much better job at this than others. 
You’ve also conveniently defined *store of value* in a short-term timeframe. I don’t think anyone investing into crypto with SoV as the main reason thinks in a short-term timeframe anyways. And anyone who does needs to do some more research because it’s been said time and time again that crypto is highly volatile and a potential long-term investment.

I could just as easily have countered with, “Let’s compare the buying power of the USD with the buying power of BTC from the peak of the last cycle to the start of this one,” and in that scenario, BTC looks significantly worse.
To be a reliable hedge against inflation, it needs to work over across more than a cherrypicked timeframe. And while there is an undeniable uptrend, the spikes that BTC has experienced could be distorting the actual valuation of (and thus demand for) BTC.

You’re forgetting a key factor in the value equation: demand.
There’s nothing guaranteeing demand for Bitcoin (or any crypto). If demand for Bitcoin falls, then so will its price.
Now, I happen to believe that demand for Bitcoin *will* go up in the future, but is it guaranteed? No, of course not. It only looks that way now because of how early we are in the crypto revolution. I liken these days to the early days of the Internet, when dot-coms starting to emerge.
Cryptos are more like those dot-coms than gold or silver. They compete with one another for userbase, for utility, for attention, etc. Each one is its own platform providing a service to users whose value is quantified by the price of its cryptocoin.

That's not true. People here regularly talk about Bitcoin (or some other crypto) replacing fiatcurrencies as a daily currency. For that to happen, it has to be a store of value in the short and mid term.

That's an assumption, not a fact.
You're right that demand for hedges against inflation will increase when inflation increases, but BTC is not yet a hedge against inflation. A good hedge against inflation is something which has intrinsic demand, meaning that people will want it regardless of the state of the money printer. That intrinsic demand doesn't necessarily exist for BTC yet, because while people (note: *people*, not institutions) want Bitcoin, they don't necessarily know *why* they want Bitcoin. That's a sign of a bubble, not intrinsic demand.
And no, wanting Bitcoin because you think it's a hedge against inflation is not intrinsic demand, it's circular reasoning. Gold's intrinsic demand is rooted in its deep cultural role as a symbol of wealth.

Are you blaming inflation, or are you blaming the fact that salaries haven’t risen to match inflation?
One is not the other. Wealth inequality isn’t directly due to inflation; it’s due to the fact that we live in a country that gives millionaires and billionaires tax breaks and then decides that the best way to disburse stimulus funds is through those same millionaires and billionaires so that they can take their first cut. EDIT: I guess I should say I’m assuming you’re American, since people from most other developed countries don’t generally have to worry about university costs. #Murica
Ironically, if the Fed adopts a CBDC that uses a fully public blockchain (as unlikely as that is), it would be a big step towards stepping away from that banks-first model that caused the inequality you lament. But not because “BTC is a hedge against inflation.” 
> Fiat cannot be ""mildly inflationary,"" by design.
Yes, they can, but let’s table this for now, because your next sentence is an atrocious misunderstanding of history.
>When the USD was backed by gold, it was mildly inflationary. That is no longer the case.
When the USD was backed by gold it caused so many bank panics and liquidity crises that countries HAD to get away from it.
It was never “mildly inflationary” except when averaged out over the whole world. On a local level, it caused so many problems that once nation-states became full fledged nation-states rather than merely conglomerations of smaller states and thus found themselves having to govern much larger populations, the lack of liquidity proved unacceptably destructive.
The gold standard is as outdated of an economic concept as judging a person’s wealth based on their land’s agricultural value. It has no place in an industrialized (let alone digitized), globalized economy that requires high liquidity.
> I would also like to point out that gold has had some pretty spectacular crashes in recent history, and it is the most popular store of value.  
I would also like to point out that gold has become more of a speculative asset in recent history, too. Probably because people pump it up as a “hedge against inflation” without understanding what that means.
If you look at its price history before ~2008, gold’s price activity demonstrates exactly why it was considered a hedge against inflation: relative stability, but overall long term appreciation."

The gold standard worked for centuries, and produced results that cannot be matched with current monetary policy. 
Many of the panics you allude to were not because of the gold standard, but because of the suspension of the gold standard during WWI and WWII, allowing governments to print currency they could not back.  
England was the first ""big"" to back off of the gold standard.  Why? Because people were exercising the gold standard (converting their bills to gold) and England essentially had to own the fact that they were running out of gold - they simply didn't have enough gold to back the currency that they produced. I.e. the panic wasn't caused by the standard itself but by the fact that the governments did not adhere to the standard. Note that both Volcker and Greenspan look on the earlier gold standard positively. 
I would argue that the current standard of monetary distortion is an attempt to paint over problems that are not necessarily monetary in nature but more systemic, such as some of the examples you cited (bank-centric, tax policy, etc.). 
QE, for example, has allowed Blackrock to buy up whole neighborhoods all over the country (with interest free money from the Fed) at 20-50% over asking, thus pricing out families, and creating an entire neighborhood of perpetual serfs. They can do this risk- free because not only is the money free, but the government has already demonstrated their readiness to bail them out.  Is this a monetary problem or a systemic problem? 
In the face of all of that, the dollar has lost a SUBSTANTIAL amount of value since 1971 (when we went off the gold standard). Meanwhile, say what you will about Bitcoin, but it is a much more effective store of value than the USD. Hell, the interest one can earn on Bitcoin is higher than USD inflation."

Oh and, for those wondering, watching 3 min charts move to the right is not an investing strategy.**
# Lump-Sum Investing
The most simple and stress-free way to invest in anything: *set it and forget it*. This method is about gathering a lump sum and investing it at whichever price you feel is suitable.
Naturally, you’re at risk for buying something overvalued or missing out on future dips/buying opportunities. But the name of the game is that efficiency doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things.
# Dollar-cost averaging
This subreddits favorite and for a good reason: it’s an age-old strategy that almost guarantees success. With this method, you invest a fixed amount over certain time intervals (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.). 
This method allows you to account for volatility and avoid emotional decision-making. But it’s indifferent to buying at overvalued or undervalued levels. Also, you may not be able to fully utilize compounding, staking, and other passive income benefits that come with lump-sum investing as well as being subject to fees during purchasing and/or transferring. 
# Risk-Adjusted Dollar Cost Averaging
The idea is the same as regular dollar cost averaging but only doing so under specific risk levels. In the cryptoverse, there are many ways to measure risk. You can use the [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), the [Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/), or advanced metrics such as the [Stock-to-Flow Model](https://www.bybt.com/pro/i/S2F) to determine whether the crypto market is overvalued or undervalued. So, for example, using the fear and greed index, you only start DCAing during *fear* levels and stop during *greed* levels.
The caveat is that you're relying on the accuracy of these models to guide your decision-making. The metrics I've mentioned have so far stood the test of time, but it's never 100% accurate, and you might miss buying opportunities at levels you think are risky but, in hindsight, are actually discounted prices. Similar to regular dollar-cost averaging you're also not able to fully utilize some benefits of lump-sum investing while also being subject to fees. 
*But what to do with the money your income flows during risky market levels?* When you're not willing to DCA into the market because of risk, you can still be invested in crypto via a relatively risk-free asset: stablecoins. With stablecoins, you can earn interest rates that are rare in traditional finance without being subject to market volatility. Of course, you're still subject to inherent crypto risks but risk and reward are siblings: you cannot expect high rewards without some level of risk. 
# Which kind of investor are you?
**Lump sum** investors usually have...well...lump sums. People with a lump sum of initial capital they're willing to invest in the market. If you want to maximize staking, interest, and other ways to compound or just want to *set it and forget it,* then this method is for you. 
**Dollar-cost averaging** can also be utilized by people with lump sums by dividing the capital and investing thru intervals. Otherwise, it's typically for people with steady income flows who are willing to consistently invest a portion of their earnings into crypto. 
**Risk-Adjusted Dollar-cost averaging** is for people who want to find an optimal balance between stress-free methods and risk management. This is because dollar-cost averaging is often criticized for being inefficient since, as mentioned earlier, it's indifferent to overvaluation or undervaluation. The tradeoff is that it's not as easy, requires some monitoring and some research into these models.
&#x200B;
Nevertheless, all three strategies are great ways for the average joe to casually navigate thru crypto investing. Ultimately, if the market continues the long-term trend upwards, either way, you're a winner for being invested in crypto."
h1l2ibd,,Comment,16,0,2021-06-12 23:30:14,"One other strategy I personally use is DDCA (Dynamic Dollar-Cost Averaging). E.g. When the asset is down 5%, I buy X amount. When it's down 10%, buy 1.5X amount, then 2.0X, 2.5X, and so on. The idea is the cheaper it gets, the more you buy. This is basically a modified version of Risk-adjusted DCA without relying on any model. The key to success here is systematic and discipline regardless what the price action is doing. Use limit orders. Set and forget!"
h1kz4p7,,Comment,9,0,2021-06-12 22:58:23,"TL;DR: lump-sum investing in crypto is very different than in standard stocks. Most should avoid it.
Lump-sum investing tends to outperform DCA in the standard stock market due to a reliable, steady upward trend , and dividends & interest being reinvested. Staking isn't at all the same as dividend and interest reinvestment and crypto can arbitrarily rise or fall 50% any given week, so DCA is a much better choice for the non-YOLO crowd."

h1l1t8w,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-12 23:23:31,"A more common strategy is somewhere in between types 2&3 from OPs post. 
You do dollar cost averaging of whatever amount you’re going to invest each month, but you take 10% of that and you store it as cash or near cash equivalent (stablecoin). 
When there’s a major market dip you take a percentage of that and buy the dip, and then you continue buying the dip at regular intervals until you’ve used all your reserves (on top of normal DCA funds). Once you’ve drained the “war chest” you eventually go back to putting 10% away once the market starts its recovery. Rinse and repeat during each bull/bear cycle until you die. 
TLDR: DCA, but also DCA the dip."

Stick with the safer investment, Bitcoin?
Or risk it with more returns with altcoin?"

h1kxagt,,Comment,7,0,2021-06-12 22:38:36,"For bitcoin to 30x it would take a much longer time compared to an altcoin. That's because bitcoin has a huge market cap, so it's a lot harder to move the price. It's important to remember that when you have a low market cap coin it can go up or down quickly in either direction. Going from 80 to 160 million may be less likely than it going from 80 to 40m, for example. Altcoins are inherently risky, whereas bitcoin is much safer. To be safe with an altcoin you'll have to find one with a good team, good tokenomics, good competitive edge, good whitepaper and roadmap, and perhaps a decent amount of volume too (unless you're betting on it eventually gaining traction)."
h1kwh3j,,Comment,5,0,2021-06-12 22:30:19,"I think it depends on how you want to invest.  Having some money in BTC is a good idea.  But investing in solid alt coins is also a good way to make money.  Investing in shitcoins, however, is more likely to lose you money than make you any."

h1kzo9a,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-12 23:04:06,"Two factors are at play… risk adjusted returns, and volume needed for growth. It takes a lot more money to support a move as market caps increase. That might seem obvious, but at a point the valuations just turn into abstract numbers. So, lower cap coins would require less cash to make bigger moves, but don’t assume all coins have the same potential. Market cap is only part of the story. The other is you need people willing to pump billions dollars into the project.
The other thing is during times of negative volatility (like now) BTC is likely to perform better than the field. Whether it loses less or gains more or both. Especially the longer this downturn goes. It’s the flagship asset in the class and its market cap offers greater stability to both the downside and just like described above to the upside."
h1l7krb,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 00:23:22,"BTC went from 0 to a trillion dollar market cap… so maybe it doesn’t have another 100x growth left.

Patently false. As is all crypto relying on btc visibility forever.  Crypto is becoming mainstream.  People are becoming more knowledgeable.  BTC dominance will continue to shrink over time.  It'll always be a phenomenal store of value but it won't always drive the entire market the way it does now.  There's already several coins that are starting to break away from it's trends in small ways.

Problem is most of these *tokens* would require more money than exists in the entire world to reach that value.  It's a scam and as soon as the *token* hits a certain price the devs sell the giant pile they kept for themselves then abandon the token.

Secondly, yes the coin amount matters, but also what matters is the price.  If a coin is worth .000000001 and has 100 trillion coins, and another coin is worth .0000001 but has a trillion coins, then they'll grow at a similar rate if bought and sold the same.  So be mindful of price vs. coin count, it can matter quite a bit.
And by burning coins, they reduce the amount of coins over time.  The thing is, with most of these shit coins, they'll be dead projects LONG before any signficant amount of coins are burned.  So ignore all these deflationary token clones."

h1kwgud,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-12 22:30:15,"fwiw, if you chart out Nasdaq from 1990 thru today, and then chart out crypto from ~2010 thru today...
2018 looks like it corresponds to the burst bubble, covid dump (March '20) looks like it corresponds to the 2008 crisis, and the May '21 peak looks like it corresponds to the present moment.   I mean, crypto moves way faster than the stock market...
Anyways there is a bubble and it definitely will burst in time.  Obviously, I can't say for sure that it hasn't already burst.   But with mainstream investors just discovering altcoins, and with ETH moving to proof of stake, I can't help but think that the bubble, or otherwise a new bubble, is going to grow a lot bigger first.
I've only been here since last year, but the recent ""crash"" reminds me a bit of what happened last fall.  A bit more pronounced this time, but small, midcap, and a few high cap altcoins peaked, some spectacularly, last summer...and then took a hit around the beginning of September due to economic concerns, and kept slowly dropping to new lows that I hadn't expected to see as covid fears stuck around and the stock market continued to lag.  One thing I learned, is that when prices rise parabolically, relatively few support levels are established on the way up, and hence there are few support levels to catch prices on the way down.  You can argue all you want about the merits of TA - but it plays out that way in crypto.
It didn't grab headlines b/c Bitcoin performed well last fall, and other high caps didn't get hit so hard."

If you look at the speed at which decentralized technology is growing, evolving and expanding its moving much too fast. 
Some examples are private or other encrypted and anonymous networks that they just can't and or won't take down. The dark web has grown and grown over the years, actually, as well as parallel networks IPFS, Freenet, Zeronet, and about a dozen others. 
Heck even the clear net itself plays host to apparently BANNED individuals that are thriving in their own little worlds. 
And to my other point. Politicians and bankers are just as dodgy as the rest of humanity and vice versa. You think they don't want a anonymity non traceable currency? You think they don't want defi solutions for their own benefits.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""
""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

nylp9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nylp9b/my_thoughts_and_analysis_of_the_bullrun/,My thoughts and analysis of the bullrun,11,23,2021-06-12 21:28:06,"There are patterns in the charts: the bull runs start earlier and end later each cycle. This is something that most have noticed.
From how I see it, eventually the bull runs will overlap each other, resulting in a balanced market and result in no bear market to feed a bull run.  
This will be adoption. When the cycles eventually float into each other so well that they follow adopted financial patterns instead, which give an average of approx. 4 year cycles (correlation to the 4 year political cycle being the most common?).  
As with all hypothesizing, only time will tell what adoption actually will look like or if any of my predictions make any sense.
With BTC, it's the 4 year PoW halving that's the most probable cause for the current type of bullruns.
The definition of ""bullrun"" is loose, so i will use these metrics: it starts at the lowest dip before a new ATH has been reached and the price can never drop below starting point of the bull run. it is concluded when there is no new ATH in over a year:  
january 2011 - june 2011 - 6 months - ATH 29,60€  
january 2013 - january 2014 - 1 year, 1 month - ATH 1.147,25$ (+3875% from previous ATH)  
october 2015 - january 2018 - 2 years and 4 months - ATH 19.343,04$ (+1686%)
By using these metrics, we look at the actual start of the flow of the market instead of the usual ""where did people start going green from previous ATH again"" and end where the flow is interrupted.
Current bullrun:  
march 2020 - today - 1 year and 3 months. this is far from an increase of the cycle. it would be the first stagnation of the length of a bullrun cycle.  
ATH 63.564,83$ (+328,6%)
By these metrics, we should reach a higher ATH. The gains decreased by 43,5% between the previous bullruns. Based on these metrics, we would be reaching an increase of 733% from previous ATH of the last bullrun, meaning an ATH of approx. 140.000$. This is of course based on limited data and should be taken as a rough estimate. In factuality, increases tend to decrease over time as adoption gets closer. 90-110.000$ would be more realistic due to the current financial situation.
&#x200B;
Corona could (and has) obviously cut down on the cycle due to lack of investment power. Our countries are heavily invested in printing money and companies are busy trying to survive.   
Have in mind though, that the increase of the price of BTC has this form of backing:
1: many BTC holders are gone. their coins will never be sold. same thing with lost wallets, faulty transactions, etc. there will only be 21 million BTC.
2: the increase in interest is often permanent. each cycle accumulates new investors which stay for the long run. some BTC never gets sold. this increase exceeds the flow of investment, as many of us got in poor, planning pension plans and such, only withdrawing at a price increase.  
institutional investment is what pumps the price the most. and original BTC holders are obviously whalish (or Welsh?) enough to act as powerfully as institutions.
3: humans easily forget something that has been shown once. we're in the 4th bullrun now. you can't ignore something that has been impactful on society 4 times. and if you can. will you ignore it the 5th time? or the 6th? eventually, old people get replaced by babies which are taught that crypto is the thing you wage slave for.
We also shouldn't be at the end of a bull run, based on the length of previous bullruns.
if we compare our current situation, please have a look at 4.1.2017, price at 1129,87$. On the 12.1.2017, it was at 802,83$. that's a 1/3 crash. not as powerful as the halving tsunami that we were hit with, but a significant blow nonetheless. there was also no pandemic raging back then. there were fewer wars. the world was more stable. people could afford to HODL for longer before they were forced to sell. cause if you overinvested money that was for rent... you can't really HODL. Not during a pandemic.
&#x200B;
All right. So now you got your confirmation bias for you to upvote my post, eh?
NOT SO FAST SHITCOIN HODLER!!!
These are the charts for BITCOIN.
I am in no way saying this bull cycle will continue as previously or that it will continue for every coin. Or that it will continue at all actually. Some shitcoins will and are already on their way straight to the core of the earth. More will follow no matter if this bull cycle will continue or not.
It's very likely that your gambles will lagoon while the top coins go for new ATH every day.
Cause if we look at previous cycles. The time of mania is followed by a time of progress.  
\- this is also where all the shitcoin earnings are reinvested into long-term HODL's.

I did a test transaction not long ago, I sent an amount of XLM from Binance to be converted to GBP in my bank account. I had to send from Binance to Coinbase Pro first of all, but there didn't seem to be any transaction fees at all. After then I had to convert from XLM to Bitcoin to GBP on there, before sending the GBP to Coinbase. This was due to the fact that withdrawing GBP to a bank account in the UK, is free and instant on Coinbase.
The whole process from Binance to bank account took around 10 - 15 minutes. There didn't seem to be any transaction fees, and the slight lowering of the transaction value, was mainly in trading on Coinbase Pro, as a small amount of XLM wasn't converted to Bitcoin."

He basically said stellar is good in the short term but may soon be shit in the long run because they have connections that are way too deep into institutions and regular markets. There too much into the asses of government people... something like that 
I like 3 coins: bit coin, eth, Ada. 
I gamble with Tell coin , and Nervos because they are mere pennys to win and may do some cool things someday soon. 
I also have stellar but I watch the project as close as I can. So far they are ‘good guys’ but maybe  they will be ‘bad guys’ in the future too.

h1n0pi1,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 13:04:52,"Again, I'm about 100% certain you don't actually understand what happened. Every one of those articles is incorrect. Transactions werent failed and none were reversed, the latter is impossible. It had nothing to do with the Stellar consensus protocol.
What did happen, was the Horizon api went down. The Horizon api is not part of consensus. The Horizon server is a tool that people can use if they want but are supposed to run their own instance. When Horizon went down consensus was unaffected. The only parties with issues are free loaders that are not running their own instance and just couldn't sync to the properly running network.
It's no different than BTC having hash declines due to the flood or whatever. It's no different than some of Ethereums nodes going down in the last month. Its not anything like the multiple consensus outages of Solana or the node failures of Nano.
It would be like your grocery stores card reader going down because they are using free wifi and claiming Visas network is having troubles."
h1n4uq6,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 13:38:30,"Actually you're right about the comparison to the China outage causing Bitcoin hashrate to decline.  That's exactly the same symptom.  Because Chinese Bitcoin farms control over 60% of BTC hashrate.  It's not as decentralized as it should be.  Actually, Coinbureau just did an excellent video about this.  
Just like XLM isn't quite as decentralized as it needs to be *yet*.  Bottom line, if a few key nodes, or an API going down, can cause a problem it isn't decentralized enough.  I never once said*anything* about consensus.  I said that the network slowed to a crawl and several transactions failed (and they did because exchanges halted them).
You're splitting hairs when my only point was that slowdowns on XLM can, and do, happen and people should be aware of that when deciding what to use.  You basically called me a liar then started splitting hairs when I provided proof that my statements were true even if the articles have the precise technical reasons wrong."
h1n5rpq,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 13:46:06,"Its actually not that great of an analogy to BTC because that was a direct consensus issue. I was merely pointing out what happened was less of an issue than recent ocurrances on practically every major blockchain. No blockchain can control the software of 3rd parties, all they can do is keep consensus chugging.
Again, the Stellar Protocol was not slowed, no transactions were reversed and absolutely nothing was affected. The issue was 3rd parties software connecting to the network. That has absolutely nothing to do with decentralization lol. I've absolutely never heard of decentralization used in the context outside of the consensus protocol.
Again, if Wal-Mart lost internet because of free loading wifi and there card readers were down would you consider that an ""issue with the Visa network"" and ""Visa transactions failing""? Like you're not even submitting transactions the readers aren't even on, pay for your own internet, Visa is fine."
h1n75b5,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 13:57:18,"At the end of the day what happened?
Transactions slowed down to the point where they were halted on several exchanges, which is exactly what I said in my original reply.
The only person who talked about consensus was you. 
Decentralization is distributing *all* resources, not just the consensus mechanism, so that there are *no single points of failure*.  If a *handful* of API providers failing can grind things to a halt that's a lack of decentralization regardless of who should or shouldn't be doing what. 
The result was that exchanges halted transactions, thus those transactions failed.  Period."
h1n7v3e,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 14:03:11,"And what happened was an issue with exchanges because Stellar was still processing transactions. What your saying is that Coinbase failed to properly run software lol. Transactions on stellar didn't slow or fail. Coinbase software failed. That's it. Just admit you didn't understand what actually happened because it's quite clear. 
So if I start an app on Ethereum and I improperly install my own software, that's somehow indication that Ethereums network is having issues and it's transactions are failing?"
h1n85d1,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 14:05:31,"That's fine, I have no problem saying that it was unclear what happened since all readily available sources of information ""had it wrong"".  
Frankly I could care less about the why.  All I care is that it gets fixed so that it doesn't happen again.  The how or why isn't my problem.  I have enough technology solutions to maintain without fretting about the nuts and bolts of someone else's software.
End of the day:. If a few API nodes failing can cause the problem then they need to be decentralized.  If they aren't it's still a problem, regardless of who's fault it is."
h1nabpc,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 14:23:26,"You don't care whether or not a protocol is functioning properly or if 3rd parties are just running their own software right? That's a pretty big difference lol.
>If a few API nodes failing can cause the problem then they need to be decentralized
Any company's API failing will always cause an issue for that company. You can't control whether a company is running its software properly. Controlling that would be the definition of centralization."

nylejw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nylejw/a_take_on_the_argument_between_pos_and_pow/,A take on the argument between PoS and PoW,28,32,2021-06-12 21:10:11,"With the current situation where millions are flocking towards Proof of Stake (PoS) due to the hype around the most notable feature, energy efficiency, it is also quintessential to look at the other side. Unpopular opinion, yes, but it is important to realize that there is also another side to the story. Especially to beginners, **this is an incredibly recommend of a read**. You will need some prior intuition about cryptography before you go any further. And of course, the worst that could happen is a waste of time and a downvote. Again, please read the whole thing through before deciding. I know, its long, but trust me.   
**Energy Efficiency** 
For starters, PoS has always held the argument of energy efficiency. With the current news running around most notably Bitcoin's energy consumption disaster (PoW) of which hogs around 110 terawatts/ hour or about 0.55% of global energy consumption (Carter, 2021), its a no brainer to skimp on energy and quickly go team green. However, this feature can quickly become a detriment to PoS.   
First off, it was a *feature* and not a bug for Bitcoin to consume ridiculous amounts of energy by its PoW structure. The release of new Bitcoins into public circulation is dependant on whether the money printers of the system (in this case, would be Bitcoin miners) decide to dispose of them in the first place. And now how is this related to energy consumption? Because mining Bitcoin takes up so much energy, the cost of electricity or investment of energy-producing infrastructure can quickly add debt to a miner, forcing them to take profits which is selling Bitcoins into the market. It is the energy-cost that acts as an economic incentive to sell and release new Bitcoins into circulation, helping bolster its adoption as the currency becomes much easier to acquire and therefore use or transact.   
There is also another way this incentive to release newly minted Bitcoin's into circulation is achieved with PoW. To tycoon a Bitcoin mining business, it is financially required for a miner to dispose of the currency (and therefore release it into circulation) in order to purchase new equipment with the disposed crypto currency's derivative (which usually is fiat). This equipment can then be used to mine more Bitcoins, and the cycle repeats.   
**The Argument Of Energy Efficiency Between PoS and PoW** 
&#x200B;
Now here's why the aforementioned is so critical to Bitcoin's intended success. 
In a theoretical world, without this incentive against miners, no new Bitcoin would reach circulation, making it harder to acquire Bitcoins. This would rapidly hike the cost of Bitcoin  but would make it so ridiculously valuable due to no new supply that the currency's monetary velocity would quickly plateau to zero. Just like the Great Depression of the 1930s, this near-zero monetary velocity would force people to stop spending or transacting Bitcoin's because in that situation, it would be more financially costly to sell the Bitcoin than to HODL it. Although to investors it would be a godsend, this situation would fail Bitcoin's primary objective as listed by her saintly creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, which was to create a *currency*, not an asset.   
Now let's compare a PoS structure to our dystopian world, but instead changing the miners to stakers. The PoS structure would fail both the distribution into public circulation features of 1), the failure to incentivize stakers to dispose of them (due to the lack of incentives like energy cost), and 2), the failure to force a detour to dispose because stakers can instantly stake their rewards of the crypto currency back into the system easily. This would cause a diminishing 'public supply' over a long period of time, and hypothetically create a situation where the monetary velocity is deadlocked. This works great for a collateralized crypto which has smart contracts for example, where the value of the crypto and/or the transactability of such remains inconsequential for its intended purpose (running smart contracts for other cryptos). However, this is horrible for a crypto where it's intended purpose is as a *currency* type of currency, not an *'asset*' of a currency.   
Now that the main parts are done, let's get into the nitty gritty parts of the comparison between PoS and PoW.   
PS: This explanation was intended to explain Bitcoin's side of the argument, not any other crypto like Ethereum or ADA. 
**Centralization of PoS and PoW**  
First off, there seems to be varying sentiment of either PoS or PoW being centralization resistant. To clear this up, in the world of mass adoption, there will always be centralization in various ways from banks hopping on the band wagon to staking/interest services. 
In PoS's case, it's a not brainer that although everyone in the system could 'technically' stake and help run the system, the main stakers would be incredibly wealthy people or companies that allowed such staking services. This obviously centralizes the system to a varying degree, but its not as bad in my subjective opinion as PoW, although this could be due to a wide variety of reasons, including that PoS hasn't been mass mass adopted, so current problems aren't as prominent as of right now. 
PoW structures have long been criticized for their centralization, both on the ASIC side where specialized individual computers can singlehandedly outcompete dozens or even hundreds of graphic cards or CPUs or that mining pools (an unintentionally centralized system of which many miners group together to increase the chance of successfully mining a crypto and splitting the awards. For instance, some companies/ organizations of mining pools for Bitcoin like F2Pool can singlehandedly weld 15% of the entire system's hash rate or 'computing power' (Statista, 2021). This obviously puts significantly higher risk of 51% attacks in the network or network change resistance (like the incident of Ethereum's EIP 1559 vs pools like Ethermine, which however was largely a failed attempt to resist), but for now, doesn't seem to be a threat. As well, hash rate markets like NiceHash are an attempt to maximize profits by setting a bet system to' buy/sell' hash rates of varying crypto currencies. Although its face value doesn't seem much of a threat, this severely infringes upon the decentralization aspect of much crypto currencies because it makes it much easier for a bad party to purchase hash power for a 51% attack than to intercept each computer.   
**Ease of Use to Support the Network of PoS and PoW**
&#x200B;
Secondly, there also seems to be conflicting ideas of ease of use to support either a PoS or PoW network.   
In PoS's case, some crypto's require very large stake requirements, of which to the regular Joe, is completely unaffordable. This however is mitigated by the increasing number of 'mini-stake' groups where organizations/ companies group up crypto from tens or potentially hundreds or thousands of users to form a single stake node. These organizations also provide extreme ease of use, most requiring just minutes of crypto purchasing and an immediate stake. Of course, this mitigation does come with the obvious consequence of centralization.   
In PoW's case, many argue that the GPUs, ASICs or even CPUs can be difficult or expensive to acquire, maintain and profit from. This, to a large part, remains unmitigated and is one reason for the change to PoS.   
**To Conclude**  
If you guys came here to support or go against anything, hate the data, not the person.   
The argument for either PoS or PoW is an extremely grey area. There is no right or wrong answer, as every structure has its own set of purposes and usability. To conclude on this matter, do your own research and keep that ol' mind of yours flexible to change. It's up to you in the long run, and this little post from a guy with internet points is just one way to help you achieve crypto mastery.

I'd love to hear from you guys, it's my first official post about crypto, and I plan to make more to help educate y'all!

This is not a bug, but a feature of pow. There is no such thing as resistance, or ""resist to network change"". A miner has the right to say **no** to a network change because that miner is the one putting POW into the network to ensure its safety at that specific moment. When a miner invests in POW they invest in a trustless cryptographic process that cannot be corrupted at their discretion, they therefore commit to proof of work and ongoing investment.
In POS a validator commits to no ongoing proof of work, a validator could stack coins in the beginning and then keep enjoying disproportionate voting rights despite not investing 1 additional dime in the network for years.
This is why POW is superior to POS, it is more decentralized because to enjoy the privileges of what you call *centralization* (high voting rights), you need ongoing investment in asics. You make it sound like asics are coins, asics *cost* to run and to maintain. So the voting privilege is earned and easily lost the moment one stops investing. In POS you never lose your voting privileges regardless of how little you invest in the network.
Unfortunately we are seeing a huge inflow of uninformed newbies and well meaning enthusiasts that have only a superficial understanding of the underlying implications of pow and pos. POS is just a short term experiment taking advantage of ignorance and circumstantial drivers like the green narrative. POS cannot provide any added value when compared to proper pow driven decentralization. POS is what we already have in the legacy financial system."

bitcoin is a push mechanism so eventually everyone will learn not to seperate themselves from their keys so that means if you spend your bitcoin on dumb things like junk over quality you will lose your bitcoins fast unless your smart and can earn more bitcoin to replace what u spend
with pos you just have to sit on a pile of coins and then you will get more and more coins you can spend on junk and low quality cuz u know you will get more coins from pos...you dont need to earn or think of a way to make more coins cuz the system just hands more coins to you

h1n42wn,,Comment,1,0,2021-06-13 13:32:22,"Your first paragraph has an interesting take on POW vs POS that I haven't seen before and would like to address. I'm going to assume that it's coming from the point of view of having a brand new coin being created, with the goal of mass adoption. If the coin already has adoption and circulation like ADA or ETH then your argument is moot - there's already incentive to use and circulate it.
For new POS coins, I would argue the primary incentives to use and circulate the coin are (in no particular order):
1. Daytrading
2. Whatever real world purpose the coin has
3. Achieving whatever financial goals the user has
If you're creating a POS coin, I'd argue the most important of these is the real world purpose of the coin. If it has no real world purpose (Looking at you SHIBA) then the only incentives to use and circulate is daytrading and natural sell-offs if the user needs fiat at that moment. If your coin is the most convincing option for a real world digital currency, then great, day trading will probably be enough incentive to keep it alive, otherwise it's probably going to die because there are a million other better alternatives.
Personally, I see no problems with any of this. Coins with attractive real world uses (e.g. creating automated, secure, trustable financial systems) will naturally succeed because there's incentive to use it for its intended purpose."
h1l2qg4,,Comment,-2,0,2021-06-12 23:32:17,"In the case of PoW, it's not reasonable to presume the amount mined will be less valuable than the energy expenditure needed to mine the currency; there's not anything which can prevent this from happening, but it's very unlikely to happen.
In the case of PoS, it allows for individuals to stake transactions, effectively functioning as a ""cryptocurrency savings account"" without the need for financial intermediaries to offer the service themselves. In contrast, PoW would need some centralization (at this time) to offer such services. Personally, I wouldn't mind if this were an option for BTC, but this doesn't seem to be happening without centralization anytime soon."

h1laclh,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-13 00:55:09,"If you are talking about bitcoin (which is the only PoW that is worth talking about, i am just assuming ETH as PoS now as the shift is inevitable by now, monero is more decentralized than btc), it is much more centralized than PoS, while the actual computing power is spread over very few entities (i.e. pools) which means it is super centralized within those who owns the entity. It just one browse away and you can easily find that there are merely less than 15 pools which controls like 90% of all hashing power and in PoW this hashing power equates to voting power. It is easy to argue that the voting power is only spread within these 15 entities compared to most PoS which can easily have 100s or thousands of nodes and therefore it is much more decentralized.
Your particular counter-argument is not exactly correct. To assume that they are purely working for the safety of the coin is dead wrong (note the word purely), in a decentralized network it is always to assume that everyone are working towards their own objective and in some cases miners (who actually hold the voting power) might not have the same objective with you as a holder. The clearest example is the EIP 1559 disagreement where holders want it but miners don’t.
The typical argument against centralization of PoS is always the “hypothetical” scenario of what if somebody somehow get a hold of majority of the coins. 
Green narrative is real btw. PoW computation is super inefficient and the particular “cOmPLeX mAtHemAtiCal cAlCUlaTiOn” is not aligned with its main objective which is to validate transactions, a good analogy is like you are asked to run multiple laps to prove that a book is yours, and those who run the most will be more likely to have a say to whether your claim over the book is valid."

Because those miners are the ones securing the network day and night as the change happens. They have earned their vote, and without their contribution the network wouldn't be as secure. So if you act against their interest, you are undermining network security.
>Instead of governance tokens or stake percentage voting, its as simple as saying yes and no to the network
Because governance tokens or stake percentage can be manipulated to benefit a few rich holders who invest $0 in the network and incentivises them to become rent seekers. You just have to think a bit about it, it's not difficult at all. Rent seeking (POS) versus investment driven cryptographic security (POW).

This time it's around .20 ratio as far as I know ..
Next it would be even way less.. let's put it into math
Suppose op got 15k karma next distribution
And ratio would be around ¼ of current let's put it 
0.05 ratio ( the ratio is completely hypothetical but it will be somewhat like this only)
So 15000x0.05 = 750 moon's
Now with the current moon to xlm value from celest 
He can earn around 750x0.216 = 162 $
This is only if he earns 15k that too highest
Now in his current situation looking at his karma points... i can find that on an avg OP gets around 
1000-600 Karma points

800x0.05 = 40moons

That's still a really good return for merely posting on Reddit.
Also, don't forget the 20% bonus for holding and 5% for the governance polls. Meaning, we don't have to 'earn' 15000 in karma points to max out, its quite a bit less.
Furthermore, comments earn double karma (at least they did in the previous round). That makes a huge difference.
Therefore, 'just' earning 6000 karma points will allow us to max out the karma points. Admittedly the 20% bonus will only apply from the following distribution."

>comments earn double karma (at least they did in the previous round)
And talking about his avg comment karma he has a two year old account which has 15k on comments and 450 on post ... So it's around 20 karma each day..
Moon's came last year so let's half it down . 10 karma points 
And that could from any subreddit. Not a ratio to be seen to add the total to moons
The last total karma is shown in the CSV every pre distribution, including double karma on comments and the normal points through post...
So it will be around the same avg karma I said above
And this will all get reduced the next next distribution.
The lower the moon's earned the higher the price goes"

o04g9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o04g9g/the_first_coin_ecosystem_i_actually_really_enjoy/,The first coin ecosystem I actually really enjoy engaging with. STMX/StormX.io,23,8,2021-06-14 23:20:10,"I'm sure most have heard of StormX. I found the coin on voyager a few months ago when I was looking for new coins to trade. I'll be completely honest, it was cheap, low market cap, and smaller sized supply. As a new trader I jumped on that shit like grandma's cookies. 
I watched it go up and down for a week or so, just doing new trader neurotic scanning the proce 24/7. One day I searched the coin on reddit and found 2 subreddits, so I gawked and found out what the purpose of the coin is. 
StormX is a company designed to be an ecosystem of earning(Earning Crypto obviously). They currently have 3 main ways to earn. Crypto cashback through purchases from over 800 partnered companies. They add a shitload of new stores weekly, some very big names as well. They are currently in 150+ Countries. The Stores name the cashback amount, you shop just like you normally would, but heres the kicker. The extra layer of earning comes from the memberships levels. The more STMX you hodl, the higher your membership level. Base level gets the standard level of crypto cashback, bronze gets 1.5x higher silver 1.50 and so on up to diamond. These stack. I'm talking stacking rewards all the way up to 87.5 percent back on top of your existing rewards. 
The second way to earn is through PLAY.  Smart contracts(I think) in the form of Games, Subscriptions, and Trials. 
Pretty straight forward, you earn straight crypto for downloading games and playing them. Same with trials, app downloads etc.
3rd way which almost everyone loves is Staking! 12.5 apa!
StormX has also started taking pre-registration for the StormX debit card with crypto cashback! Again this card will be stackable with the partnered stores, plus the membership bonus, plus the debit card percentage. They call it the Crypto Triple Stack. 
They also want to add a Governance Feature, and Person to Person Smart contracts for Task based Esrning which I think would be cool as hell. Basically Fiver, Honey, And Rakutan combined!
The best part is that you can recieve your crypto cashback in multiple different coins. BTC LTC ETH STMX and more. 
Anyways back to the self story part, I've done enough shilling. 
Well the more I looked into it the more I used it. I purchase something off the StormX app weekly. I have not had anything in crypto pull me in so heavily. I love the UI, and the community. The discord shares purchase ideas, and different upcoming milestones. My friends all have the app as well, amd we talk about our purchases. We compete and laugh on who else has more an got the best deals. Obviously I'm critical as well since my money is involved. 
I really think this company will be something special. 
Not telling anyone to do anything just wanted to say that the more I look into different crypto the more I love crypto. Everyone dreams of LAMBOS and mansions. I just like making money buying crap I wanted to buy anyways. Give it a look if you have not before."
h1t5c64,,Comment,5,0,2021-06-14 23:22:37,Now StormX is a name i haven't heard since late 2018
h1t7wvu,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-14 23:47:55,Currently Stacking  and staking had a decent run earlier in the bull run hopefully we get back there and beyond
h1uynef,,Comment,3,0,2021-06-15 11:49:22,"Holding and still in the green despite everything last month. It’s a solid platform for long term investment. Lots of little impatient people though, you can see them weekly having a sook  because they’re not going to the moon yet 🙄"
h20lec1,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-16 17:24:50,"The problem with stmx is 
a) it didnt even capture 1/2 of its ATH price in this massive bull run so it doesnt look good at a brief glance. 
b) 22 million dollar is already staked at 12.5% but who is paying for that? 
c) triple dip sounds cool and all but who is paying for this? Remember the amount of cashback stores are willing to pay is fixed. If someone is going to make 20x for shopping at a brand when the brand only pays stmx 5x then where is the money coming from if not from those who buy the coin later? What happens if the coin doesnt explode like it almost is designed to. 
d) you can already earn BTC cashback through lolly, fold, etc so competition aleady exists and with mass adaptation of crypto, more crypto cashback platform will rise up. 
e) actual cashback isnt taxable but cashback in the form of crypto is
f) good luck being a competitor to ebates. They are dominant as fuck. They already have an excellent credit card with a legimate bank that you can call, chat, etc and if you want to ""triple dip"", you can take advantage of their partnership with amex. None of this requires staking of a coin that could be displaced by something else that geta marketed better. 
g) its crypto. On paper it could say you earned 5% cashback but if the price tanks by half before you cashout, you have only made 2.5% before tax. 
h) too many whales in this coin."

h1t52xa,,Comment,2,0,2021-06-14 23:20:10,"Staking in a ETH2 pool works like this:
1. You move your ETH to a participating exchange/pool
2. You stake it and receive tokenized ETH in exchange for real ETH (1:1)
3. Your real ETH is locked until the ETH mainnet implements shard chains.
4. You get daily rewards in tokenized ETH
&#x200B;
Once side chains are live you can swap tokenized eth back to real eth(1:1)"

h1tqip8,,Comment,82,0,2021-06-15 03:45:54,"What people forget about market cap.... (No, not the usual thing... please read on)
It's based on all the coins in existence. 
But actually the price of the coin is really based on all the coins *in circulation*, aka, the real supply vs the demand.
Eth is being bought to stake, which is like the money invested into mining equipment. Do we include the cost of GPUs into the market cap? No, of course not. 
The circulating supply of Eth will be much much lower than the total market cap. This is why a companies value is often based on it's circulating supply, and excludes shares not in circulation, like vested shares, or CEO owned; the ""free market float"" valuation method.
 
The price of Eth can be much higher than $10k without the free market float flippening BTCs."

It depends on the time frame you are looking at, it could be tomorrow or it could be years from now its better to be patient and keep stacking. 
You also have to consider inflation $1 trillion will be worth a lot less 10 years from now. BTC and ETH will likely function as a better holders of value compared to USD. With El Salvador and other south american countries making crypto legal tender that could rapidly accelerate adoption. If countries like Iran and India with large populations adopt crypto currencies, the numbers I mentioned (BTC around 550k and ETH around 30k-40k) will look like chump change."

200% gain is 3.00x your investment  
300% gain is 4.00x your investment

600% gain is 7.00x your investment  
700% gain is 8.00x your investment

I guess the question is, which one has more buyers looking only for short term gains?
I would probably point to the people who buy to participate in Defi. 
Who buy some Eth to use for gas on other tokens.  
And staking, staking will be a big one. Did you know there is currently approx $20b worth of capital securing the Eth network on PoW? (Assumes all the hashpower comes from 3090s, and that they have a market value of $2500 each)  
If that were to be liquidated, and spent on Eth to profit from staking instead of PoW (not realistic, but humour me for a moment), that would buy around 50,000,000 Eth at current prices. 
That would be half of the supply. 
Now, I'm not saying all the miners will sell their cards for full value and send every dollar into staking... but... how many will?
And with no need to sell the staking rewards to pay electricity bills... a lot of that Eth will be locked back up into staking.
Point being, staking is a big reason. Defi is too though."

With the current supply, that's a market cap of only 60 million dollars. I know that sure as hell would change my life, even if the gain wouldn't be huge to some people."

I was introduced to it recently through that Matic Guy in this post  https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/np3rgz/a_deep_dive_into_polygon_matic_and_quickswap_3/   and used it to swap several tokens and try out providing liquidity since Uniswap fees are so high. Its a super low mkap of 80Million which is  #343. Current liquidity is 1.45 Billion and 343 Million volume in 24 hours. The one ""negative"" thing that I would point out is that current supply is 159,000 out of 1,000,000. I know at least a portion of this is being distributed as rewards for providing liquidity which seems like a good way to incentivize liquidity. It seems natural to me that people will use scaling solutions like matic at least for the next year or two minimum and a Uniswap copy will prosper just like Uniswap has done well. What do people think about QUICK?Are there any major red flags or issues with tokenomics that I'm missing ?"

There's a guy on Shrimpy that had a whole Polkadot portfolio I was following for a while.  With all the volatility though he's converted it to usdt for now, but he called it the Polkadot Ecosystem and it consisted of:
Polkadex (PDEX)
0x (ZRX)
Polkamarkets (POLK)
Dock (DOCK)
Polkadot (DOT)
OriginTrail (TRAC)
Ankr (ANKR)

o03xp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o03xp1/discussion_staying_privatesecure_in_crypto/,[DISCUSSION] Staying Private/Secure in Crypto,4,1,2021-06-14 22:53:05,"As is common knowledge on this sub, if you have crypto, it's a good idea to keep it lowkey that you have crypto. This not only includes family and friends (except maybe a spouse), but also government agencies, including certain 3-letter organizations that are [very interested in learning about crypto users these days](https://decrypt.co/41411/the-irs-is-offering-you-625000-to-crack-monero).
Mind you, I'm myself a law-abiding citizen and I'm in no way advocating for anyone to do anything illegal with cryptocurrencies. However, it remains that, if anyone has any info on you or your crypto, including literally any sovereign state, then it's a security vulnerability. Case in point, just knowing that you own and use crypto would be enough to trigger an audit and/or further legal action that you'd rather not deal with and could very easily avoid by taking the necessary precautions (while, again, not doing anything illegal).
Some ways to stay secure against the Department of Dirty Tricks:
First of all, get your coins the fuck off of Coinbase; [the Federal Court has approved an IRS subpoena at Coinbase that puts thousands of users at audit risk](https://www.goldinglawyers.com/coinbase-audit-do-you-have-bitcoin-income-tax-or-reporting/). Exodus or Metamask will do if you've securely stored your BIP39 passphrase in either physical storage or store your seed phrase in an encrypted and password-protected fashion (the latter is a lot harder to do **correctly** than the former if you don't have a background in the technical side of cryptography). You can also keep your keys offline altogether with a Ledger or a Trezor depending on your threat model (Will hackers Trojan your computer and log the keystrokes to your encryption passphrase?)
Moreover, consider buying Bitcoin and other cryptos off of the Bisq DAO @ [bisq.network](https://bisq.network) in order to avoid KYC/AML. You can pay with Zelle or with a money-transfer account in, e.g., Western Union or Moneygram; there would be no evidence that you purchased cryptocurrency other than the audit trail on the account itself, and that would be a P2P transfer that could have happened for any number of reasons (as far as regulators are concerned). You would only have to justify the transfers in the case of spending more than USD$5-10K a month on the network, in which case it'd be good have an audit trail of all your crypto trades presentable. In any case, this is a lot more sensible than buying large amounts of crypto on Coinbase where your ID is associated with the amount of crypto you're holding in your account.
Finally, invest in common-sense security, including a \[preferably open-source\] password-manager like Keepass or Bitwarden (""p@ssw0rd"" is not secure!), a VPN, and cloud storage either with zero-knowledge encryption (Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive do NOT count) by default or with GPG encryption, etc., from your side. You can also consider enabling 2FA with either your phone or with a trusted hardware device like a Yubikey; if you're using an app on your phone, try to pick an open-source alternative to Google Authenticator like Aegis or andOTP.
Curious on what other crypto-enthusiasts think about internet privacy in this day and age of all-too-common state censorship and surveillance... Feel free to discuss!"

I see people talking about thrifty ways to gain more money all the time on this sub.   I rarely ever hear people outside of buying and selling stuff talk about reallocating funds into investments by making cutbacks to their daily habits.
But I see these same people who say *crypto bad, crypto scary for x reason* going around needlessly blowing money they don't need to spend for short term conveniences.   Like locating a gas station that's 20 cents cheaper per gallon.    Ones on highways and super busy intersections are always more expensive.   It's inconvenient to turn off and drive 3 more blocks out of your direction. But something as simple as that wastes $100 a year.     Imagine all the other things like paying for premium cable service just to binge watch one show for 2 weeks straight when you can spending $100 less a month just getting internet only with Hulu, Netflix or whatever.  Deals are great now. I spend $50 a month now. I haven't seen good premium deals like that in 20 years for that price.    Then you add phone service to that.  That's another $50 people are wasting every month. 
Before you know it you're wasting thousands.  Buy high quality coffee, and take a nice hot cup to work .  Don't stop at Starbucks and waste $4 everyday on a cup.  And you're wasting time waiting in the drive through wasting more gas..
Just saying.  Really very little people should be opening their mouths about crypto being a risk or scary or energy wasting."

I'm still amazed at how many otherwise smart and well educated people make some pretty terrible financial mistakes (usually around depreciating assets like cars, or just buying way too much house for their income level, which comes with a whole stack of extra expenses in taxes, maintenance, and mortgage interest). 
Investing has made me way more intentional about my spending habits. I've gotten a little better at spending both my money and time on the things that align with my long term goals, and forgoing the things that don't. For that I'm grateful."

I do all the managing but her being so independent will sometimes override what I say.     
I don't want to go off on a rant but one example is we were in a hole when covid hit. Both our businesses went to 0 for a couple months.     We needed a short term loan to get us by what we owe, and for the next 3 months or so till we are back in business.    I specifically stated "" do not use this loan to clear off your Credit cards...pay the min because the mortgage and taxes are more important""
She ignored this and used the entire loan to pay off credit cards that had a lower interest rate than the loan itself.      Taking out higher interest loans to pay off lower interest loans defeats the purpose of a loan.   Might as well just say ""don't approve me for the loan, and here...take a few thousand for your time"""

o03c0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o03c0i/ark_invests_yassine_elmandjra_postulates_if/,"ARK Invest’s Yassine Elmandjra postulates if businesses in El Salvador, and other emerging markets, demand payment in Bitcoin instead fiat, this could lead to fiat devaluation and exacerbate inflation. If hyperinflation ensues, watch out!",4,2,2021-06-14 22:21:17,"
El Salvador has become the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. On Wednesday, the Salvadoran Congress approved a bill drafted by President Nayib Bukele to make bitcoin legal tender. The bill passed with 62 out of 84 possible votes, a supermajority.
Now that the bill has passed into law, in El Salvador prices can be denominated in bitcoin, tax contributions can be paid in bitcoin, exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to the capital gains tax, and merchants must accept bitcoin as payment. The entire bill can be read in full here.
According to Coindesk columnist Frances Coppola, by adopting bitcoin El Salvador is committing to a hard-currency peg and more monetary discipline, breaking with its monetary and fiscal policy dependence on the US.
As we highlighted in a whitepaper published last year, bitcoin could become an important savings vehicle in emerging markets, so much so that businesses might demand payment in bitcoin instead of fiat. If so, the velocity of their fiat currencies would accelerate, causing currency devaluation and exacerbating inflation as measured by their sovereign currencies. In the unfortunate event of hyperinflation, fiat-denominated debt would become worthless and dollar-denominated bonds unpayable.
While the Bitcoin network has not evolved enough to service an entire economy, in our view the demand for bitcoin in emerging markets could increase as its infrastructure scales and reaches critical mass. We believe iif bitcoin were to capture just 5% of the global monetary base outside of the four largest fiat currencies - US dollar, yen, yuan, euro - its market cap could increase by roughly $2 trillion."

However, I've seen tons of news about Binance and Coinbase Pro ""exit scams"" with the leverage tokens earlier, or just people having trouble withdrawing (I haven't had any issues I wasn't able to solve yet).  Not having real customer support or a body in the US that I can appeal to makes me want to hold/deal as little crypto as possible there.
Some of this is probably just FUD (especially since Coinbase is a publicly traded US company...) but I don't see any reason to take the risk.
Any recommendations for the easiest and safest ways to trade? I'm thinking about buying a hardware wallet finally, but once I have funds on a hardware wallet, where's the best (also quickest, cheapest) place to trade? Don't want to have to wait 7 days for funds to be available, or get eaten by gas fees (I usually only buy $50-$200 at a time).
Also, how much cash (stablecoins ig) is it worth/safe to keep on exchanges? Do you all port new money over every time you want to make a purchase?"
