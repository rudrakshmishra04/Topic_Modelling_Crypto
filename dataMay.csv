If it makes you doubt for even a second you need to rebalance. You wouldn't have to sell everything, but tossing some of it into something else if it crashes to sub penny levels again you'll be able to buy so much more of it. For DOGE specifically, I'd look hard at taking half of it out. You would still have a ton for it to go to 100$ a coin or whatever, it would still make you millions, but you have the opportunity for 60k right now even if it crashes and never recovers.

It's a bracket though so you wouldn't pay 24% on the whole thing, just the parts above a threshold. The lower brackets you'll pay a lower amount. I'd think it would work out to an effective tax rate of about 20% for the 100k and 16-17% for the 60k. If you've held for Less than a year doing math could really minimize the tax you owe. Longer than a year it doesn't really matter.  Again not an accountant just a stranger on the internet, proceed with caution not tax advice."

You pay more in taxes on that 40k than you'll pay on the 60k because self employment taxes are about 10% higher. I'd think of it Like that's way to, would you stop working to avoid a tax rate, or not take on a new customer? Hire a good accountant for next tax season and they will probably save you more money than they cost as well. You also can do less. If you took 40k now and held the rest, you'd be saving an entire years worth of wages into investments. I'd be more than happy to say 100% of my work income went into investments this year.

So for example if I have 100 coins in whatever crypto and let’s say I’ve spent $200 for those coins. Now if my profit for those coins were to increase to $1000 and I want to move that $800 profit and use it to purchase other coins later or even transfer to my bank account.
The best method would be to transfer $800 worth of that specific crypto into USDC and then wait for a dip to buy either the same coin or something else at a cheaper price?
Also, if I am to move that profit of $800 into my bank account that means I’ve lost out on a percentage of the 100 coins I’ve bought and if that coin were to rise significantly in price than I have really just missed out. 
Sorry if it’s confusing but please correct me if I’m wrong. Is converting to usdc and buying the dip the best way to keep profits??
Thanks!"
gy6htfu,,Comment,4,0,2021-05-14 23:54:25,"If you spent $200 on that 100 coins then each coin was worth $2.
If your 100 coins increased to $1000 then each coin is worth $10.
So if you wanted to move that $800 profit to USDC or some other crypto then you would ""trade"" 80 of the 100 coins. Which means you will have 20 coins left worth $200 if the price is maintained at $10 each.
And if you want to know the best ways to keep profits, do your own DD (Due Diligence) to know how to do that because nobody really knows and everybody's risk tolerance are different."
gy6hfxr,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-14 23:50:25,"You've got the basics. Personally if I had something I paid 200$ for that was sitting at 1000$ I'd sell 30% and keep 300$ in the rainy day fund. Along with 700$ in the asset that made me the money. But from that point on, I'd look at the asset as costing me 700$. Obviously use your own percentages, it's going to be different based on your personal finances and risk tolerances."

gy6i8cl,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-14 23:59:00,"Yeah because what I’ve noticed is that usually when the value rises it ultimately dips back to the same price it’s been stagnant at. I guess that’s the volatility of the market but in that case it’s just better to hold until years down the road when the profits are significant rather than lose coins for a couple $100 dollars... unless they are some memecoin or low potential coins. 
Would I be correct in this assumption ?"
gy6jl0t,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-15 00:14:21,I live in a tax jurisdiction but wouldn’t I only pay taxes on it if I have actually transferred that money out of crypto and into my bank account ?
gy6jgvj,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-15 00:13:01,"Well the coins are only worth as much as it is currently priced. Meaning that 10 coins worth $10 is the same thing as 1 coin worth $100. The thing about crypto is you can always buy and sell where you can adjust your risk tolerance to how much profit you predict to make or lose.
It all depends on the fundamental of the coin and how much hype is for it. For example, dogecoin's fundamental is dogwater because of how it was made as a meme and creates 5.2b coins per year (high inflation rate), but since its hype and brand name is well known, it is going up up and up. 
So to answer your question, yes it is better to hold if you believe in the fundamentals and buy more to average down hoping to have better profits in the future. But that is a big if on the fundamentals since crypto is a wild west market right now and some other tech can make that coin's fundamentals irrelevant at any time."
gy6k56x,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-15 00:20:50,"You'll have to check your tax laws where you live. Here in NZ once you swap it for another coin its taxable. Most people think the tax event occurs when you swap to cash to sell out. That is not the case, well not here.

Having never dealt with share or crypto before and end up with a huge sinking feeling. Cause they took the dopamine hype rush from internet hype boys. Hard to see honestly but I guess everyone has to learn someway.

Is he referring to value of the network as inverse to the risk of holding it?
He might have a point.  I am a big fan of proof of stake, but it does seem to have a problem.  PoS depends upon distribution for security.  In theory, you take control of PoS network by owning a lot of it or controlling ownership of a lot of it.  On the other hand with proof of work, you have to pay high ongoing costs to keep the network corrupted.  
There are selfish reasons why a rational actor might not ever do that, but what about a powerful, irrational actor?  (Ex: an AI virus that is not entirely aligned with or is unwisely used by its creator) And there are practical reasons why PoW might stay broken if a 51% attack radically altered the ability of is victims to marshal a response.
So while PoS attacks might be harder to initiate against a robustly distributed system, they might or might not be easier to maintain, and a PoW system might be easier to temporarily overcome (in, for instance, a physical war) at the end of the day, does it take more work to physically or logically attack a network?  I think the greater cost to maintain in a PoW system argues that it ultimately stays more secure."

Then divide that number by bitcoins price. This is the upper ceiling for a coin. Now set a reasonable goal of money you want to make on this coin. Take your upper ceiling and divide by this goal, this is the amount of coins you should buy. Maybe 2-3x if you really believe in it but don't think it will be BTC levels. See how much money it would cost to buy that many coins right now. Does it seem like a small amount on your current income level or does it seem like a huge purchase, or an impossible one? If it's a small amount buy, and hold. If it goes way up, sell some but not all of them. If it was a huge purchase or an impossible one, rethink your goals, and find a lower number.

Don't worry too much about the current rate if you're planning on holding it for a while. Then use that amount as a learning step. Watch how it rises and falls and how other coins are affected by it. Get a feel for what it's like to go into the red, back into the green and back and forth for a while. See how you can handle the emotions. Keep coming on here to read up and learn about what's happening and why. 
Do all this to make sure you can handle and enjoy the process before investing too big. It's not for some people."

gy6gli3,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-14 23:41:19,"Market cap is basically the sum of supply times price. If an asset, crypto or traditional stock has 1000 shares at a market price of $10 then the market cap is $10,000. Those are arbitrary numbers and are not an accurate representation, I just used small numbers for explanations sake. The point is, the current market price means nothing if you don’t factor in supply. Take the same price of $10 but the supply is 5000 instead of 1000. The one with 5000 shares/coins is more expensive even though both are $10."

gy6p7ae,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-15 01:23:25,"I think you have some good projects here. I also think you aren't sufficiently top-heavy. You have the start of a good foundation with BTC at 30%, but you might consider taking profits from your smaller market cap coins into DOT, ADA, ETH, VET until 60% or a little more of your portfolio is in top 20 coins. That would make your foundation super-sturdy and still give you room for explosive growth in the rest of your portfolio.
A word of caution from someone who was REALLY happy with 35 coins - you can't manage them all. When the market does turn bearish, you need a plan for each and every coin - how you'll get it out of staking and onto an exchange to sell while everyone else is doing the same thing. 
I ended up having to cut back on my number of coins substantially. That way, I can properly manage the coins in my portfolio (i.e. maintaining balance through profit taking, knowing what dips to buy,  etc.)
Just food for thought. At the end of the day, if you're happy with it and it will make you money,  that's all that really matters... just make sure you MAKE money (take profits on the way up)  and not end up holding Hella bags through the bear."

I keep on thinking back *""What if I dumped in a bit in x coin back in 2017?""* every now and then. Because one of them actually did became a moonshot. Even though I had only put a measly amount of coffee money.

gy6fxv7,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-14 23:34:14,"25 is extreme? Perhaps to you it may seem it extreme but it all depends on your perspective. I'd call it personal preference more than anything else.
From personal experience, having a portfolio with 15-20+ different coins/tokens does require more effort with keeping track, but it can be done with relative ease.
Personally I've found holding more than 15 coins does presents it's own challenges, however it also paints a clear picture on daily market behaviour. Also, not having all your eggs in one basket does provide some comfort, it also safeguards against rug pulls which could prove to be problematic if you only hold 3-4 token/coins. Diversity shouldn't be viewed as extreme, at least not in my book.
Just on diversity, lets say things go south with one of your faves, but you've 24 others to balance it out, its not so bad. If things go south when only holding 3-4 you've potentially lost a quater if not a third of your holdings. 
I get that holding 25 or more isn't for everyone, but there aren't any hard n fast rules as to an amount you should carry."

gy6dvr0,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-14 23:12:30,"The market is quick to react, and when it doesn't that often means there is a problem. Perhaps one of the exchanges isn't currently allowing withdraws. I saw this with DOGE a few weeks ago. One exchange has it for $.10 less, people ran over to buy it, only to realize there were no withdraws.
Fees are going to vary for every coin, so you really have to do the calculations each time. Don't forget taxes in your profit calcs."
gy6dyr4,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-14 23:13:22,You’d be fighting algorithms & day traders for tiny scraps & paying retail fees. I’d stick to swing trading if you have spare time.

Trading is a rough game and fees in this world aren't friendly so that's another hurdle. Unless you've got deep pockets, a solid plan and the ability to absorb a fuck up... I'd steer clear. Making dimes whilst risking dollars can go pear shaped quickly."

And the quantum computers wont suddenly just work. There will be many steps and during those steps the evolving quantum computers will also be used to encrypt any relevant blockchain coins more deeply.

Besides every single coin (no matter where you think it is on your own personal “shitcoin”->”good project” coin-tinuum) is still tied to fiat at this point and “value” is almost arbitrary. Show me something that’s not tied to fiat and explain how it will scale and solve a major inequality, and you’ve got something interesting to talk about. Stop trashing DOGE, if you don’t like it, don’t invest, or share something positive for people who might like DOGE AND something else.

What options do I have?",3,22,2021-05-11 23:55:57,"So my kid made an ETH address (he is under 18). I have a CB account and wanted to send some ETH to them to get them started.  But $30 to send a few bucks...no thanks.  He used MEW to make their wallet.  I thought about converting to something like LTC and having them make an LTC wallet so I can send it cheaply, and then do a conversion back to ETH after the fact...but that would have to be converted on his end...and without access to a market service for them (CB, binance, kraken, etc..) what options do I have?"
gxtdaf5,,Comment,4,0,2021-05-11 23:58:11,"Convert it to XLM, then send. As that is the cheapest way to move. But then it will not be eth.
If you are set on it being ETH. I would recommend just deciding now how much to set aside, perhaps even stake it. And wait for fees to go down. Then move it to a wallet for them.
As if they are not going to touch it for a while, then it is not too important to have it in a separate wallet just yet.
*Edit. I think Gemini has 10 free transfers a month. 
If you set up a Gemini account you could transfer to it via XLM, then covert to eth and send to a wallet. I do not use Gemini so I am a little hazy on any restrictions."

Your best bet would be to purchase a cryptocurrency with no fees (like Nano) or low fees like (Monero) and have the exchange send it to his wallet or you can just purchase Ethereum and do the same."
gxte4tn,,Comment,0,0,2021-05-12 00:06:39,"The option is to wait, but when the gas fees finally settles down, there is a risk that the market movement had calmed down due to the consolidation process or (the worst case scenario) ""correction.""
There is a certain ""risky"" option involving converting your coins to other alternatives that is far cheaper to transact with and maintain some sort of stability (as of right now, I think it's correct that you are picking LTC to bypass the insane fees).
There is the riskiest possible option that I can think off... Using DeFi to ""fund"" your kid's wallet. They often require no KYC and you can participate in exchanging to USDT (the closest thing to fiat).
There is perhaps an option for ""P2P trading"", but that is best left as last resort option."

It shouldn't cost you $30 to send $5, digitally.  That just utterly blows my mind.
Real world use case:  My friend has some service he provides. I like his service. I use his service. I pay him for his service because crypto is a form of payment he accepts. An invoice for $30 shouldn't be $60 cause the fee to click a button is that high (because of all the computational energy, blah blah)."

gxtfe6f,,Comment,6,0,2021-05-12 00:19:42,"""Gut feeling.""
I often assess sentiments on Twitter (as invalid as that might be). The coins that only consisted of let's HODL or to the moon posts without any thought put to its use. I shall put several examples below:
1. Cardano for academic records in Ethiopia
2. Ethereum is self-explanatory (**Ethereum and utility token is almost a synonym**)
3. VeChain as ""proof-of-authority"" that is utilized to secure the supply chain management in business such as BMW, and
4. Chilliz or Tezos that is ""consumer-friendly"" for collectible tokens... no matter how stupid I might see NFTs are...
5. ChainLINK for data oracles
6. LTC for ***cryptocurrency transactions*** because of their speed and very low transfer fees (and **there are projects with** ***lower*** **transfer fees than LTC)**
7. Bitcoin as store of value (**the largest bar none in terms of market cap**)
8. USDC, USDT, DAI, and many other stable coins (USDT has no assets to back them up; if things go tits up, there is a chance that 1 USDT **does not equal** 1 USD)
9. Polkadot, Cosmos, and MATIC (Polygon) for interoperatibility solutions between blockchains
10. DOGE for light-hearted, fun, and gesture of friendliness towards your family (I am dead serious about this) that might provide them a taste on cryptocurrency and their use
11. And many other blockchains that employ solutions to the proposed *Bitcoin Trilemma*
For me personally, **a coin with a good use case** ***must*** **be able to tackle the** ***Bitcoin Trilemma*** **before they are capable of staying long in the market.**
To determine the concept, I often look at the dApps (if any) and their forums for development. I am no programmer... but it does not take very high degree of tech-related knowledge to know something is up.
Since this is a bull run, coins that pop out may propose similar use cases above... I personally use the history as the indicator of the coins' staying power. If I see a new project that is similar to the previous dead coin post-2018 crash, I would stay the hell away from it unless they give me a perfectly good reason to not to."

But it is far from a pump and dump scheme. The latest development update noted that Ravencoin is starting to use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) that is perhaps going to be usable in all things NFT and trying to make it simple. The integration of IPFS hopefully can eliminate the prevalent issue of NFT being copied and pirated... Hopefully. It is one of the few bastions for remaining PoW miners with the equipment to mine after ETH 2.0 goes live; that's just wishful thinking on my part, but that is one of the few reasons that it is not poofing out of existence yet despite the relatively modest development.
DOGE is just a memecoin that had become a scapegoat for pump and dump scheme, sadly. If people peg it as 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, the vitriol against it would not be as intense as the recent times."

nafote,https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988,Vitalik proposed that UNI should become an oracle token. Can someone please explain the significance of this?,24,15,2021-05-11 23:46:03,
gxtkk4b,,Comment,7,0,2021-05-12 01:16:03,"I'm not remotely technical in this, but based on my understanding, he suggests that UNI should have its token help dictate the true price of ETH
How it does that is based on UNI token holders voting with UNI
How that defines and pegs the true price of ETH? I have no fucking idea because I am smooth brain
Either way, an oracle system on UNI would be beneficial as an oracle has the ability to take data from out of the block chain network and process the external world's information into something usable and valuable to the block chain network"
gxtqq37,,Comment,5,0,2021-05-12 02:35:24,"[This is is the cross-posted discussion by Vitalik himself beyond yonder the Ethereum sub](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/naah8x/proposal_for_uniswap_uni_should_become_an_oracle/).
The point expressed by u/Bluemandegen had pointed out several shortcomings on why UNI being an oracle token would be undesirable; **UNI with its on-chain transactions are already ""oracle-like"" in nature; in this case, UNI prices interact with the off-chain through the price of external market** (my point is that the UNI market players already act as the ""external data"" for the oracle???).
One of the key problems raised in accordance to the proposal by Vitalik is the **difficulty of UNI governance** should they choose to adopt them as a token (as pointed by the forum member there in the first reply against Vitalik). Again, I cannot ascertain as to why would this matter; the post above perhaps refers to the ""difficulties in governance in the current state"" that might translate poorly should additional feature be added on the project.
Micah had also mentioned this (one of the core dev of ETH). Below is the quoted post:
>An escalating oracle can take a very long time to resolve.  
>  
>For things like CDP (collateralized debt position) liquidations and interest rate adjustments which need to be done quickly, this can be problematic.  
>  
>Also, it can be very dangerous if the assets under management of the oracle (how much can be stolen by the oracle lying) exceeds the market cap of the oracle token (UNI in this case) by 2x since it becomes profitable to rob the system via governance attack.
However, the benefits that I can understand from this... would be to open up a **new synthetic market** due to the oracle feature (should it be) implemented.
That being said... I am no blockchain expert... I am just another monkey that have done reading classes. I think the next thing that we would need to learn in order to understand the discussion further is to read up on how Augur system works... Vitalik said that he wanted to model the oracle feature like the ones in Augur.
Read up a post by ChainLinkGod on the forum (he is genuinely knowledgeable on the subject despite his name indicate otherwise). In terms of **safety and timeliness** for CDP liquidation, it is perhaps best left to automated scripts or AMM rather than human-voting systems from Augur/UMA system (his words, not mine). But again, this would reinforce Micah's view about the risk of **DeFi exploitation** through price manipulation that could trigger the smart contract in question; asset loss through that way in DeFi is not uncommon and had been occurring with increasing frequency, especially with the current bull run.
Overall, I cannot make a satisfactory nor acceptable conclusion on what stance should I take about Vitalik's proposal with my current gaps of knowledge; I truly wish those who had been reading and using Augur/UMA to be able to provide feedback on my incomplete and extremely shallow understanding in regards to the DeFi sphere.
Keep in mind that I am talking strictly from utility and feasibility perspective in regards to the utilization of the proposal above; price increase will eventually occur on the project that provides sizeable utility."
gxtppbx,,Comment,10,0,2021-05-12 02:21:26,"AFAIK oracles are Tokens/Blockchains/Programms that basically translate and validate real world data to the Blockchain. Normally e.g. ETH can't use the information ""It's 5C° outside"". UNI could basically write this information into a contract so that ETH and everyone coding on ETH or relying o validadet Information can use this info.
&#x200B;
Don't ask me how they do it or how UNI should be transformed into this. I have no clue. The main significance is, that UNI gets another (potentially) huge usecase"
gxu2mw8,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-12 05:39:51,"Uniswap now is a governance token, meaning it has no other value than to vote on proposals within Uniswap app.  
Oracles are a method to onboard verifiable information into smart contracts. Currently the most relevant use cases are providing price of asset to the inquirer. The largest player in this space is Chainlink that power hundreds of decentralized apps, but Uniswap has their own oracles. I believe that Vitalik suggested for Uniswap to add functionality to UNI token and to use it to pay the information providers, as well as collateral for oracle nodes."

It’s hard to wrap my head around. How can someone own a meme and have it be “one of a kind”? How can anything digital be one of a kind? Everything can be copy and pasted. Especially if it’s an old meme...not like you can go back in time. Is it DRM? Is it like the Mona Lisa? Where the original is worth a lot and one person has it but you can still go to the flea market and get a copy for $10? If that’s the case, can anything digital be an nft? Not just memes, pics/vids, but music? Video games? Ebooks? This is the link to the weirdness btw
https://ethmeoutside.com"
gxtczeh,,Comment,7,0,2021-05-11 23:55:07,">How can anything digital be one of a kind
To put it in a easy to understand manner, lets pretend there is a Pokemon card NTF. If you know about collectible cards, you will then know that even though there might be x1000 first release Charizard's they are all worth huge amounts of money.   
But can't people just copy them and print them? Not at all. They all have a unique serial code on them which also contributes to the value (the lower the serial code, the more it sells for). Sure, due to it being a card made from some sort of paper you could just get extremely good and replicating it to fool others. But you are not able to replicate things on blockchain.
""But cant people just copy the card from the NTF and then they have it? Not at all. Each item on a NTF comes with a special serial code special to that digital item. Also, it lives on the blockchain. You are not able to just copy a card and add it back to the blockchain. Its the same with how you can not just copy and paste a bitcoin back into the blockchain to get two of them .  
Think about it as owning a bitcoin, but instead its a unique digital asset with its own serial code. In terms of the cash me outside meme, it does not matter if those memes are on Youtube because the blockchain means you can actually own one of the first released ones. She might only release, say, 100 cash me outside memes on the blockchain. If you are one of the 100 people to get one and 100000 people want it (because she is famous) then the value of your meme absolutely sky rockets.   
I hope this makes sense. I am happy to explain more!"
gxtczx2,,Comment,5,0,2021-05-11 23:55:16,"Think of nfts like a celebrity signed collectible.
It's often not the collectible itself that has value, but the fact it is signed by someone famous related to it.
The winning baseball of famous game? Nice. That same ball signed by the one or more players at that game? Significantly more valuable.
As for the danger of more being minted. Look at books. No matter how many times a book is printed and reprinted, the ""first editions"" will hold or even increase in value to collectors. Then you get an author signed first edition and it becomes even more valuable. Though scarcity is a factor still. If the author signed 10 million first editions it will be far less valuable than a book where the author only signed 1 or 10"
gxtcxvk,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-11 23:54:42,"Of course anyone could sell the meme as an nft, and in that sense it’s not unique in any way, aside from its Id. But none will be as valuable as the one that can be cryptographically verified as the one that she sold as the “official”. So ultimately it is the artist or figure that gives it its value. The nft allows for tamper proof digital verification of authenticity. Furthermore, most nfts are just links to some content somewhere else. So you could sell access to any digital product through an nft."

Now for you, you have to buy into BC because if you arent sold on this idea then NFTs wont matter. Here's a starting point: do you own Crypto? If yes then youre halfway from understanding the value of an NFT.

gxted51,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-12 00:09:02,"Not a problem! The idea of NTFs made no sense to me when I started, until I got involved with NBA Top Shot which sells moments in NBA history but there are only a limited amount and some high tier players like Lebron James sell for a huge amount (some cards going for over $150,000). Its like card games. You purchase a pack of 3 (some have more due to special packs etc) and have a chance of getting a high tier player.   
To answer your question, you definitely could! For music, a artist could release 100 songs and due to them all having their own serial number and being on the blockchain they would be unique. Imagine if a extremely famous artist released only 100 songs on the platform? The would sell for thousands of dollars."
gxtfnrt,,Comment,4,0,2021-05-12 00:22:25,"That is completely fine! Its almost like how developers create their own coins like Bitcoin, Etheruem with the difference being that each NTF token is unique where as all bitcoin are worth the same therefore not unique.   
In terms of how to make a official NTF, I would highly suggest reading a few articles to get an idea of. Here is a extract from a article:   
""Ethereum blockchain is the basis for most of the currently offered NFTs because it supports the ERC-721 token standard, enabling NFT creators to capture information of relevance to their digital artifacts and store it as tokens on the blockchain.  
When you pay for an NFT, what you get is the right to transfer the token to your digital wallet. The token proves that your copy of a digital file is the original, like owning an original painting.""  
Do not stress what the ERC-721 token standard is to much. Here is a simple explanation of what it is: 
""The ERC-721 introduces a standard for NFT, in other words, this type of Token is unique and can have different value than another Token from the same Smart Contract, maybe due to its age, rarity or even something else like its visual."".   
Now, to answer your question. It is like a registration. Well, kind of. Here are the steps to creating your own NTF:   
**Step 1: Set up MetaMask.**  
The first thing you’ll need to do to create your own NFT is to set up a software wallet. This wallet can hold your NFTs and you’ll also need to use it to pay blockchain gas fees later on. ""  
&#x200B;
**Step 2: Tokenize your art.**  
  
Once you have a MetaMask wallet created, you’ll be able to create your own NFTs.   
  
Navigate to opensea.io and click the Create button in the menu bar. Now you can connect your MetaMask wallet with OpenSea and get to work.  
  
Create a name for your NFT collection, then click the Add New Item button. You are now ready to upload the file you want to tokenize and give it certain properties and stats to distinguish it from the rest of your collection.   
  
Determine how many copies you want of each item, then set a retail price.  
\-   
I hope this answers your question! I could of just sent you the steps, but I thought it would be a bit more beneficial for you to understand it a bit better."

While this could be true, it has nothing to do with the value of 1 unit of coin. Eth is as likely to double in price whenever a single coin is 4k or 40k, same for BTC (assuming weighted market cap)
Btw, while I'm more bullish for Eth than BTC, it's usually more likely that an asset doubles in price after a consolidation phase than after a huge rally"

From what I understand, the project is quite ambitious. I have invested for a couple of reasons but would like to learn more before getting more involved.
I was doing some research and the end goal is really intriguing to me. It *seems* like they are working towards a decentralized internet space. Is that correct?
If so, does that mean they would be working as an ISP? Or are they providing a different kind of service?"

You can an deploy an application in the decentralized/ distributed infra, just like deploying apps to the cloud. 
Seems interesting, but still need to do research on how it handles the application’s immutability.

gxtas3q,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-11 23:33:43,"Decrypt: Crypto industry insiders estimate that the funds managed by Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) now exceed $1 billion—up from about $10 million a year ago. In 10 or 20 years from now, we’ll see “Silicon Valley in the cloud,” powered by DAOs, rather than corporations, Aaron Wright, co-founder of the OpenLaw digital contract platform, argued at Decrypt's 2021 Ethereal Virtual Summit last week. ""DAOs will probably be viewed as the organizational entity for the Internet age,” Wright said. “I really do think that this is the future.”
Keep safe, thanks and good luck again!"
gxtj744,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-12 01:00:40,"tldr; Crypto industry insiders estimate that the funds managed by Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) now exceed $1 billion. DAOs have been used by groups big and small to manage protocol development, fund investments, or fulfill various other missions. A new Wyoming law recognizes DAOs as a new type of limited liability company.

It also didnt pump because everyone executed at the same time, it took literally a year before anything happened after it was first discussed. What you state in your post is pure ignorance to the facts.

Since Shiba has 1 quadrillion coins if each was worth 1 cent it would have a market cap of $10 trillion. Just shows how even though it has a tiny tiny price it really couldn’t go up that much because of how many are in circulation

Usually this only pertains to coins with pretty decent cost (ie BTC, ETH, MKR) anything in the thousands. A coin that’s in the cents or dollars is pretty easy to buy. 
I first got into crypto because of Bitcoin. This was when it was just about to pass 20k near the end of 2020. Sadly, BTC decided f it, it’s time to rocket and the amount of money I put in couldn’t even offset how fast btc was rising. After a couple months I sold my holdings and dumped it into ETH. Having the ability to own a full coin, as dumb as it sounds, actually feels like an accomplishment. 
Now I’ve been looking at trying to get some MKR and have been looking at YFI (ever since it’s been in the 20k’s) but these crazy ass coins are rising so fast I feel like I’m in the Bitcoin situation again. I might try and push for MKR but YFI, at it’s current price of almost 90k, seems out of grasp. 
Do any of you guys have that desire to own a full coin? Especially if they cost a fortune to own even one."

There's also word going around that gemini withdrawals will be an option in the future.
Everyone collecting BAT on brave has a wallet with them where your rewards are stored until you claim them with uphold or tip them.

I feel like other coins might have better potential but if you’re able, stocking up on doge isn’t a bad idea at all. 
Litecoin has also been doing good for me this year. It recently dipped too so keeping an eye on it for a chance to get in is a good plan IMO. Chain link has also been great for me within the past month. It did reach an ath recently so I’d keep an eye on it and wait for a dip if I were you. But I see that coin reaching ~500 within the next 10 years, maybe even higher. I obviously can’t predict the future so the opposite can also happen lol.

I am not necessarily looking for all the nitty gritty on what exactly cryptocurrency is- what I am more interested in is some info from people who are already in it- things like how exactly to invest in it. I would be looking at investing a very small amount of money to get myself used to it first. 
Obviously, I have done the google search and they all say to get a wallet etc, but since I don't know anything about this, I am afraid of downloading the wrong thing and attaching my card info to it. 
I've been browsing through these posts but a lot of them seem directed towards people who already have a working knowledge.
Thanks in advance if anyone can help me."

Coinbase has more options, trust wallet is where you can get a lot more smaller cap coins... IMO I would go with voyager and or Coinbase to start. Research projects, find one you like put a small amount in and slowly expand your portfolio. Happy investing!"
gxt99wt,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-11 23:19:17,Google Gemini. Find the top link that’s not a add. Then your fine. Either DCA or buy a dip. Get some ETH and BTC to start out. Do some research.
gxt9duu,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-11 23:20:15,"-Find a reputable trading platform suited for what you intend to do (day trade, long, etc).
-I recommend doing your due diligence on what type of projects you’re going to invest, but right now it seems like you can’t miss.  
-Only invest what you’re comfortable losing
-There are 10%-25% swings that you’ll have you get comfortable with and learn to take advantage of them. 
-almost every time I’ve bought and sold something, it’s continued to go past the price in which I sold...so I’ve learned to buy and just hold or time your conversion form coin to coin."
gxta8w3,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-11 23:28:32,"There are trusted exchanges that you can link a CC to. I use kraken and coinbase. 
You can also use PayPal to buy crypto and then transfer it to an exchange if you don’t want to use their purchasing services. PayPal is pretty trusted. Other people use Robinhood.
Just be careful when sending coin to different exchanges because if done wrong, it could get lost forever. Experiment with a few dollars. If you copy past address, it’s pretty fool proof. 
Some people don’t read the sites guidance on how long some coin takes to transfer between sites. Other sites will allow you to use them, but then want you to verify your identity before you can send or receive. 
As far as investing, that’s all on you. Coins do different things. Some do absolutely nothing and are a meme. Some allow banks to transfer or exchange money faster and more secure. You just have to read about their purpose and invest in what you like."
gxtclrg,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-11 23:51:20,"I say, first just read a lot, and don't jump into buying out of FOMO. Check our different coins and what they do (Coinbase has videos where you get coins for learning about coins), and go from there. Ask lots of specific questions. Good thing is, most people are very helpful. Don't give out your seed phrases when you get a wallet!"
gxtmkfy,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-12 01:40:33,"My advice:
Consider using an exchange that pays interest on your coins. Several of them pay compounding interest in the coin that you’re holding. Definitely an added element of making your money work for you in the market. 
I made [This Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit) that compares interest rates of 15 different exchanges on 130+ coins. 
Feel free to dm me with any questions you have. I’m not a professional investor or anything. Just a regular guy who is passionate about the crypto space. I spend a lot of time reading lol."

The Internet Computer provides a completely different kind of environment that runs at web speed. It cannot be hacked or stopped. It uses advanced computer science, to create a new kind of environment, which is totally different to the old environment. And it is better because it executes at web speed.
How does it work? Nodes, special secret nodes. There are already a thousand data centres running the special nodes. The smart contracts run as designed against the expected data, at web speed, using advanced computer science, which cannot be hacked or stopped. The secret is in the dilithium crystals, which allow smart contracts to execute at web speeds.
You havn't heard about it because of it's technical complexity and abstract vision. Experts love it, tech nerds love it. The code will be open-sourced soon. The governance will be community driven. It will connect everything to everything. It will change everything about everything. The Internet Computer is created by the Internet Computer Protocol. The smart contracts will be written in code, and will execute on computers, at web speed."

You can plug in your exact hashrate in [whattomine](https://whattomine.com/) to see your return. It's currently a LOT higher than 5 bucks a day. More like 15."

Do test out a bunch of miners, some can net you a bit higher Hashrate than others. For me NB miner and Phoenix were highest.
Also it can depend on the pool you're mining in and its current luck in block discovery, so give it at least a day or two to get a decent average.
I get very similar dollar value out of Nicehash as with mining on Ethermine, but usually a few % more on Ethermine."
gxuda7y,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-12 07:58:31,"Don't switch to Nicehash, it is guaranteed to make less profit than the two best Ethereum pools, which are Ethermine and Flexpool.
If you're a single GPU miner, Ethermine is the way to go.
And if you have a 30-series card, you should be using Trex miner."

If this is your first day on ethermine, it will update the estimated earnings after running it for 24 hours to a more precise estimate. 
I'm running two cards that add up to 73 mh/s with an estimated earnings of .00462 ETH/.000348 BTC/$20.02 daily. 
As I understand, ethermine mines it's own gas so you pay less on withdrawals fees. 
Just stick with ethermine... Or go to nicehash. It's your call after all.
Edit: added estimated earnings"
gxtbdmo,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-11 23:39:25,"Give it a whirl. NORMALLY it’s within $0.10-20 different from mining ethereum or other coins directly but since last Friday or maybe a bit earlier it has skyrocketed. How nicehash work is other people pay you in bitcoin to rent your hashpower, highest bidder wins. So any time a mineable coin rapidly increases in price, people jump onto it and pay you to mine it. So rather than just locking yourself into one coin, you get the benefits of being able to mine any coin/whatever is most profitable at that moment."

I'm not sure if this could be a worthwhile competitor with Twitch, FB and Youtube. What's the benefits and is it worth it?
If anyone is really savvy with this platform can give me a quick synopsis of how this works, I would really appreciate it.
From what I know so far:
* Tfuel is like the gas that runs the blockchain.
* Viewers ie, Sharers get paid in Tfuel which is transferrable into other coins or Theta.
* Sony and Samsung has backed them up.
* Theta isn't tradable.
* You can stake Theta tokens.
Is it a profitable venture?
Thank you for your input in advance. I am going to keep reading through their whitepapers but anything I learn here will help."
gxxvruk,,Comment,11,0,2021-05-13 00:00:53,"Couple of things to address. Theta is far more than a streaming platform—it is not a competitor to YouTube or any other content platform. Theta is instead a last-mile video delivery solution, comparable to a CDN, which aims to drastically reduce the cost of delivering content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix, to you, at home. They achieve this by relaying content to edge nodes, which then distribute the content to other users. Edge node operators are paid for their services, instead of paying for the services of a server farms and storage racks. 
The Internet is effectively at capacity, and global bandwidth demand is outpacing infrastructure’s ability to grow to meet it. Enter Theta—a way to allow common computer owners a way to share their excess computing power for an incentive.
The idea is to eliminate the bottlenecking that occurs in the “last mile” of video delivery, which is by far the most expensive mile for video distributors.
Theta can be traded. There are 1 billion theta tokens, almost 60% of them are staked currently.
It’s also important to note that Theta Labs is effectively a Silicon Valley tech company who also operates a decentralized blockchain project. Theta Labs itself is a central organization running out of California. They have deep ties to founding members of the video streaming industry, including Steve Chen co-founder of YouTube on their core team of media advisors.
They have partnerships with Lionsgate, they have Sony, Samsung, Gumi, Google, and others as enterprise validator partners, meaning they stake somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of Theta’s supply to secure the network. The rest is staked by you and me, running guardian nodes.
In addition to all of that stuff, Theta is also a full-on blockchain, yo. Smart contracts are in full force, and Theta is hot into NFT’s at the moment. Mainnet 3.0 is released on June 30th."

gxxwc1k,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-13 00:06:42,"If Elon considers doge to be a protocol designed for maintaining purchasing power, then he needs a refresher.
Doge was created with a protocol designed to drive the price down to worthlessness to encourage its use as an educational/meme cryptocurrency. That is per the creator himself. Doge will short itself based on the pure magnitude of new coins minted each year. When a bear market comes, people aren’t buying doge and the miners just keep selling which will continue to drive price down as coins are dumped into the market without a bull run amount of buyers
It’s the purchasing power of a coin that matters, not the amount in circulation. Purchasing power derives from scarcity and disinflationary characteristics. With that in mind, we see that an infinite coin cap is unnecessary and antithetical to maintaining purchasing power
If Elon were to recognize this, then I don’t see Elon doing anything other than messing with doge for his own gain like you say. He may be trying to low price of BTC so he can buy in lower if he understands BTC to be a better multi-decade investment"

Bitcoins value increase propped up Teslas Financials last quarter. The spokesman/owner states Tesla will sell 10% of their Bitcoin Holdings to check liquidity. The following week he tweets a negative statement which drops the price of all crypto massively. WHY? Duh, let's see. Tesla has massive debt, not enough income currently, and a new factory to build. This guy is fighting to keep his company afloat. So now they can buy back into Crypto with the 10% they sold and who knows how much more at a great below market price. The jokes on anyone who thought he cares. He's one of the richest men in the world. You don't get there by playing fair, you gotta be shrewd, take huge risks, and manipulate the masses and profit off of them. A lot of Elons ventures are government backed. So he's been in bed with the government and he's in their pocket. If you decide to Invest in crypto you should do so because you see the future in it. If you make a quick dollar that's awesome.

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. It is a decentralized currency with no central issuer, no central control. That is the appeal. As a result, people trust it more than central banks. It is also the #1 crypto trading pair out there. It has a use.
People buy Ethereum to pay eth network fees to run dapps on the network. There is a use case.

Safemoon is potentially trying to change the game with their exchange which is scheduled for Q4 2021. Do I believe in them? Yes. Would I trust them with my life savings? No. 
They are trying to introduce tokenomics, which in theory sounds like a great  idea (in theory). They 1000% have no use right now. It took Bitcoin a decade for it to useful for everyday use (even today it his big flaws). 
Anyone saying Safemoon is gonna moon tomorrow or in a week or a month is straight up delusional, but this coin has serious potential and shouldn’t be written off as a scam just yet. 
Edit: 
Technically when Bitcoin eventually finds an equilibrium price people that buy into it will technically make a loss with fees and it most likely won’t stabilise at an all time high. 
Kinda sounds like a ponzi"

Also the exchange is looking to bring tokenomics to every crypto, I have no idea how it’ll work. But gaining btc,eth or xrp passively could be worth the extra 5% fee of selling."
gxy24ar,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-13 01:12:30,It sounds similar to the Kucoin exchange. Buying Kucoin shares and holding them on the exchange gives you small portions of fees charged to people buying and selling coins. It could work in theory but building an exchange is easier said than done.

Just think of the employees in their cars driving to work, millions of them, into big buildings that need to be cooled and heated, all their computers, all their internet, the lights, security; I could go on and on.
That's no good for the environment, and neither is bitcoin mining.
One obvious solution is solar power and of course Musk is involved with that as well.  I tried getting solar shingles from his company and was rejected because of trees on my property blocking the sun.  A fully solar powered mining setup would be amazing.
Until then it seems like proof-of-stake for things like Eth 2.0 will be beneficial.  Am I right about that?"

I get the intention behind the proposal, but who is not to say that a post won't get deleted because of (whatever), or through other manipulations like you mentioned above? I've seen a couple of useful posts getting deleted in the past and the mods weren't quite able to defend their actions. I think those posters deserve to have their karma counted. I'd much rather have those getting the recognition than those who just spam memes or gif and generate a large number of upvotes."

Don’t give the governance system control over rewards by making the software all open, and the relationship between the paid and the payer p2p. This whole absurd inflationary token pays you via upvotes while making the weight of said token provide governance is absolutely the dumbest model. 
Good content will attract advertisers. Advertisers provide money. Creating money via inflation is bad. The issue with most versions of the ad system is that they operate under a exploitive opaque model. A privacy respecting p2p model fixes that. 
But Reddit is centralized and closed so such a system will never work. Moons will only degrade Reddit faster so I’m all about it, but it should be known that it’s a bad system."

He is not delivering astronauts to the ISS for free.  He is making money.  Don't buy all the bullshit that Elon is selling you.
He is a billionaire because he cares about money."
gxxsq5e,,Comment,5,0,2021-05-12 23:30:37,"He also makes brain to computer interfaces via neuralink.
But yes he is currently working on making vehicles, autonomous driving, more rugged and efficient vehicle manufacturing,  tunneling machines, tunneling techniques, converting tunneling waste into building materials, more efficient propulsion systems, reusable rockets, solar cells, batteries and battery storage systems, electric charging infrastructure, satellites and satellite based worldwide internet... Etc.
The only major colonization tech he is not currently revolutionizing  to my knowledge is farming. But that may just be due to how thin he is currently stretched."

In fact getting to space in general will bring musk gigantic profits with things like asteroid mining, selling trips to other planets, contracts to launch and maintain space stations, etc."
gxxt6s1,,Comment,3,0,2021-05-12 23:35:04,"OP isn't wrong. Watch some interviews with him, he legitimately thinks he will have a city with tens of thousands to millions of people living in it in his lifetime. All his other shit, tesla, even space X as a business, all the money and finances are all to be used for this one goal.
He has expressed this desire numerous times publicly. If he wasn't a billionaire who owns the most successful private rocket company on the planet, which is actively developing the tech to deliver massive payloads to mars, I'd think he's insane."
gxxt9px,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-12 23:35:51,"I am not\* really falling for is bullshit, I also believe he has a very strong ego problem.
The fact he is delivering astronauts for money to the ISS does not go against my point. Quite the opposite, same with ""getting Doge literally to the moon"" whatever that means. Serves no purpose but money/publicity.
My point is he wants as much money as possible as fast as possible and he is REALLY focused on that right now because Mars."

gxxz8a7,,Comment,0,0,2021-05-13 00:38:16,"One of the chief engineers of Nueralink just quit, Tesla isn't fully autonomous yet. He's claimed from 2017-18 that it will be so, literally when Tesla was in a bad state financially. Building tunnels through cities is pretty stupid, tube makes more sense in his ""energy efficient"" ploy. He's manipulated markets with false claims. 
SpaceX I have to say is doing well and revolutionizing the industry, otherwise he's repackaging stuff. I don't mind him doing all his antics, just that he pied pipers his fanboys to a ditch and they are still happy about it. Musk makes false claims on the guise ""research is painstaking but optimistically we'll do it this year"" all to manipulate markets and enrich himself."
gxxsf69,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-12 23:27:40,I have to admit that it is a possibility.
gxxtlfj,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-12 23:39:00,I really do get that. I just had to write this up to try and make sense of all the recent bs with him for myself.
gxxu6om,,Comment,2,0,2021-05-12 23:44:52,"I really do not believe he is a god, quite the opposite. He is a smart person for sure but is goals are selfish in many ways. All he wants is to die on Mars, he said it many times, he will do anything (almost) for it. He does not give a shit about this planet (or not much shit) or at least I do not believe so."
gxxuekq,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-12 23:47:06,Quite possible indeed but he needs way more that that. Obviously that is just a guesstimation from my part but there is still rivers of money needed before a man sets foot on Mars.
gxxv6dv,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-12 23:54:47,"Kind of what I am saying, he only wants Mars. I am merely adding that it helps to always think MARS when you read anything from/about Musk.
If he tweets about horses, a good reflex should be to ask yourself what horses and Mars have to do with each other."
gxxunci,,Comment,0,0,2021-05-12 23:49:31,"No, see I disagree.  He isn't focused on Mars.  He's focused on building a product that can make him money.  Boeing wasn't focused on space travel.  They were focused on providing a product in exchange for money.
All the talk about Mars is just PR for the products he wants to sell.  Just like a green future is PR for Teslas that he wants to sell.  He's not trying to solve the world's problems, he's trying to make more money.
I'm not even saying that it's inherently bad or evil, but just that's what his goal really is."
gxxzpjl,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-13 00:43:44,oh interesting! I will have to check that out. I wasn't even aware he had a brother. lol.
gxy0kb8,,Comment,1,0,2021-05-13 00:53:45,"Whether or not he eventually succeeds at any, or all, of his projects is almost irrelevant to me. Just the fact he is working on them has prompted more public attention and industry innovation in those sectors. Especially in electrifying vehicles, popularizing battery power grid storage, offering world wide high speed internet, and pioneering reusable rockets. 
Causing other companies to really step up their game in these areas."

I mean ""why build something for Mars when you can build it for Earth and Mars and sell it here first?"" seems to be the way Musk works...
Oh and he also has a sister and maybe another brother? and a shit ton of kids.... for colonization I assume ;)"
